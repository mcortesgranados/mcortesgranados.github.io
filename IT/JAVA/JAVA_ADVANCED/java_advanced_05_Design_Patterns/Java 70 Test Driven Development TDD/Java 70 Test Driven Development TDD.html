<h2>Test Driven Development (TDD) - Set 1</h2>
<div class="question">
  <h3>1. What is Test Driven Development (TDD)?</h3>
  <p><strong>Answer:</strong> TDD is a software development process where you write tests before writing the actual code to pass the tests. The cycle of TDD is: Red (write failing test), Green (write code to pass the test), Refactor (clean up the code).</p>
</div>
<div class="question">
  <h3>2. How does TDD improve code quality?</h3>
  <p><strong>Answer:</strong> TDD ensures that code is tested at every step of the development process, which helps in reducing bugs, enhancing refactoring capabilities, and promoting clean and maintainable code.</p>
</div>
<div class="question">
  <h3>3. What is the purpose of the "Red" phase in TDD?</h3>
  <p><strong>Answer:</strong> The Red phase is when a developer writes a test that fails because the required functionality has not been implemented yet.</p>
</div>
<div class="question">
  <h3>4. What is the purpose of the "Green" phase in TDD?</h3>
  <p><strong>Answer:</strong> The Green phase is when the developer writes the minimum code necessary to pass the test.</p>
</div>
<div class="question">
  <h3>5. What is the purpose of the "Refactor" phase in TDD?</h3>
  <p><strong>Answer:</strong> The Refactor phase is when the developer improves the code structure, optimizes performance, or makes it more readable without changing its functionality.</p>
</div>
<div class="question">
  <h3>6. Can you demonstrate a simple TDD example in Java?</h3>
  <p><strong>Answer:</strong>
  <pre>
@Test
public void testAddNumbers() {
    Calculator calc = new Calculator();
    int result = calc.add(2, 3);
    assertEquals(5, result);
}

class Calculator {
    public int add(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }
}
            </pre>
  </p>
</div>
<div class="question">
  <h3>7. How does TDD help with debugging?</h3>

  <h3>91. What is the importance of test-driven development in continuous integration?</h3>
  <p><strong>Answer:</strong> TDD plays a crucial role in continuous integration (CI) by ensuring that every piece of code pushed to the repository is tested automatically. This allows for early detection of issues and ensures that new code does not break existing functionality.</p>
</div>
<div class="question">
  <h3>92. How do you deal with test failures in TDD?</h3>
  <p><strong>Answer:</strong> When a test fails, you should investigate the failure by reviewing the test, the code being tested, and any changes that may have caused the failure. After identifying the cause, fix the issue in the code, ensuring the test passes, and run all tests again to confirm everything works correctly.</p>
</div>
<div class="question">
  <h3>93. What are the key differences between unit tests and integration tests in TDD?</h3>
  <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Unit tests in TDD focus on testing individual units or methods in isolation, usually with mocked dependencies, while integration tests verify how multiple components interact with each other. Unit tests are fast and run frequently, whereas integration tests are typically slower and run less often.</p>
</div>
<div class="question">
  <h3>94. How do you ensure that tests are maintainable over time?</h3>
  <p><strong>Answer:</strong> To ensure tests are maintainable, write clear and concise tests, avoid duplication, and refactor tests as the code evolves. It's also essential to regularly review and update tests to keep them relevant as the system grows and changes.</p>
</div>
<div class="question">
  <h3>95. What are some challenges when adopting TDD in a legacy codebase?</h3>
  <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Adopting TDD in a legacy codebase can be challenging due to the lack of existing tests, tight coupling between components, and the absence of automated testing infrastructure. Refactoring the legacy code to make it more testable may also require significant effort, but it ultimately improves code quality and maintainability.</p>
</div>
<div class="question">
  <h3>96. How do you handle test doubles in TDD?</h3>
  <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Test doubles, such as mocks, stubs, and spies, are used in TDD to replace real objects with simplified versions that simulate the behavior of dependencies. This ensures that tests are isolated and focus solely on the unit being tested.</p>
</div>
<div class="question">
  <h3>97. How can TDD help in understanding business requirements?</h3>
  <p><strong>Answer:</strong> TDD helps in understanding business requirements by forcing developers to clarify the expected behavior through writing tests. This leads to better communication with stakeholders and ensures that the software meets the business goals.</p>
</div>
<div class="question">
  <h3>98. How do you handle performance bottlenecks in TDD?</h3>
  <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Performance bottlenecks in TDD can be detected by writing performance tests alongside functional tests. Once identified, optimizations can be made to improve performance without compromising functionality. These tests can be integrated into the CI pipeline to monitor performance over time.</p>
</div>
<div class="question">
  <h3>99. How do you determine when to stop writing tests in TDD?</h3>
  <p><strong>Answer:</strong> You stop writing tests in TDD when all the functional requirements are covered, edge cases are tested, and the system works as expected. The test suite should give sufficient coverage of the application and ensure that the system remains stable and robust over time.</p>
</div>
<div class="question">
  <h3>100. What are some best practices for writing tests in TDD?</h3>
  <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Best practices for writing tests in TDD include writing tests that are small, focused, and isolated, using descriptive names, maintaining a fast test suite, and writing tests for both positive and negative scenarios. Tests should also be continuously refactored to keep them readable and relevant.</p>
