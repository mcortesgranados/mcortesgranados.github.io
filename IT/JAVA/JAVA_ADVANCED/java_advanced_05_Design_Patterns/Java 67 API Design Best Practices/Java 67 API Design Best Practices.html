        <h3>Set 1</h3>

        <div class="question">
            <p><strong>1. What is REST and how does it relate to API design?</strong></p>
            <p class="answer">REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style for designing networked applications. It uses a stateless communication protocol (usually HTTP) and emphasizes scalability, simplicity, and the use of standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to access resources. RESTful APIs follow these principles to enable easy interaction between client and server.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
            <p><strong>2. What is the importance of using HTTP status codes in API design?</strong></p>
            <p class="answer">HTTP status codes provide standardized information about the outcome of an API request. They help clients understand whether the request was successful, whether there were issues like authentication failure or validation errors, or whether the server encountered an issue. Proper use of status codes ensures clarity in communication between clients and servers.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
            <p><strong>3. What are some best practices for naming REST API endpoints?</strong></p>
            <p class="answer">REST API endpoints should be intuitive, consistent, and descriptive. Use nouns to represent resources and follow a hierarchical structure, e.g., `/users/{userId}/posts`. Stick to plural nouns for resource names, avoid using verbs (use HTTP methods for actions), and ensure that endpoint names follow standard conventions (e.g., lowercase letters, hyphens instead of underscores).</p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
            <p><strong>4. Why should APIs be versioned, and how is versioning typically implemented?</strong></p>
            <p class="answer">API versioning is important for maintaining backward compatibility when introducing changes. It allows clients to continue using older versions of the API while migrating to newer ones. Versioning can be done through the URL (e.g., `/v1/users`), headers (e.g., `Accept: application/vnd.api.v1+json`), or query parameters (e.g., `/users?version=1`).</p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
            <p><strong>5. What are idempotent operations, and why are they important in API design?</strong></p>
            <p class="answer">Idempotent operations are those that produce the same result regardless of how many times they are called. For example, making a `GET` request or a `PUT` request with the same parameters multiple times should have no side effects beyond the initial request. Idempotency is crucial for ensuring reliability and preventing unintended actions in APIs.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
            <p><strong>6. How do you handle authentication and authorization in an API?</strong></p>
            <p class="answer">Authentication verifies the identity of the user or system making a request, while authorization determines what actions they can perform. Common techniques for handling authentication in APIs include using API keys, OAuth, and JWT tokens. For authorization, roles and permissions are typically enforced on specific resources or endpoints based on user credentials.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
            <p><strong>7. What is the difference between REST and GraphQL?</strong></p>
            <p class="answer">REST is a traditional architectural style focused on stateless communication and uses standard HTTP methods for resource management. In contrast, GraphQL is a query language for APIs that allows clients to request specific data, minimizing over-fetching or under-fetching. GraphQL offers more flexibility in data retrieval but can be more complex to implement and secure.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
            <p><strong>8. How can you improve the performance of your API?</strong></p>
            <p class="answer">Performance can be improved through caching strategies, such as using HTTP cache headers or a distributed cache (e.g., Redis). Additionally, pagination, batch processing, and limiting the amount of data returned by the API can enhance performance. Rate limiting can also prevent abuse and maintain a consistent user experience.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
            <p><strong>9. What is the significance of input validation in API design?</strong></p>
            <p class="answer">Input validation ensures that the data received by the API is correct, complete, and safe to process. It helps prevent issues like SQL injection, data corruption, and application crashes. Proper input validation ensures that the API behaves predictably and securely, protecting both the system and the users.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
            <p><strong>10. How do you document an API effectively?</strong></p>
            <p class="answer">Effective API documentation should be clear, concise, and accessible. It should include information about available endpoints, request and response formats, error codes, and examples of typical use cases. Tools like Swagger/OpenAPI provide automated ways to generate interactive API documentation, making it easier for developers to understand and use the API.</p>

              <p><strong>1. What is the purpose of rate limiting in API design?</strong></p>
              <p class="answer">Rate limiting is used to control the amount of traffic an API can handle over a specified time period. It helps prevent abuse, ensures fair usage, and protects the API from being overwhelmed by excessive requests. Rate limiting can be implemented using techniques like token buckets or fixed windows, and helps maintain the stability and availability of the service.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="question">
              <p><strong>2. How do you handle versioning in a RESTful API?</strong></p>
              <p class="answer">Versioning in a RESTful API allows changes to be made without breaking existing clients. Common strategies include versioning via the URL (e.g., `/api/v1/users`), using custom headers (e.g., `Accept: application/vnd.api.v1+json`), or in the query parameters (e.g., `/users?version=1`). It's important to make versioning clear to users and maintain backward compatibility.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="question">
              <p><strong>3. What are the key principles of RESTful API design?</strong></p>
              <p class="answer">The key principles of RESTful API design include stateless communication, uniform interface, client-server architecture, cacheability, and a layered system. RESTful APIs focus on using standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), and resources should be represented using standard formats like JSON or XML.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="question">
              <p><strong>4. What is the role of API gateways in microservices architectures?</strong></p>
              <p class="answer">An API gateway is a server that acts as an entry point for all client requests to the microservices. It performs various tasks such as load balancing, authentication, authorization, request routing, and response aggregation. By consolidating these functions, API gateways simplify the management of multiple microservices and improve scalability and security.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="question">
              <p><strong>5. Why should APIs support pagination, and how is it typically implemented?</strong></p>
              <p class="answer">Pagination is important for managing large sets of data, ensuring that clients can retrieve data in smaller, more manageable chunks. It prevents performance bottlenecks and unnecessary data transfer. Pagination is typically implemented using query parameters such as `page` and `limit`, or `offset` and `count`, in the API request.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="question">
              <p><strong>6. What are the security best practices for designing APIs?</strong></p>
              <p class="answer">Security best practices for APIs include using HTTPS to encrypt data, employing proper authentication mechanisms (e.g., OAuth 2.0, API keys), validating inputs to prevent injection attacks, implementing authorization controls (e.g., role-based access), and applying rate limiting to prevent abuse. Regular audits and penetration testing can also help identify vulnerabilities.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="question">
              <p><strong>7. How do you handle errors and failures in API design?</strong></p>
              <p class="answer">Error handling in API design involves returning consistent and informative error responses. This includes using appropriate HTTP status codes (e.g., `404` for not found, `500` for server errors), including error messages in the response body, and providing error codes or documentation for troubleshooting. It’s also important to avoid exposing sensitive information in error messages.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="question">
              <p><strong>8. How do you ensure your API is scalable?</strong></p>
              <p class="answer">To ensure an API is scalable, it's important to design it to handle high traffic volumes efficiently. This can be achieved by implementing caching, load balancing, horizontal scaling (adding more servers), and optimizing database queries. Using stateless communication and decoupling services via microservices architecture also contributes to scalability.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="question">
              <p><strong>9. What is the importance of consistent error handling in API design?</strong></p>
              <p class="answer">Consistent error handling ensures that clients can easily understand and handle error conditions. By using standardized error codes, messages, and formats, clients can quickly detect issues and take appropriate actions. Consistency in error handling also improves the maintainability of the API and reduces confusion for developers using the API.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="question">
              <p><strong>10. How do you handle rate limiting and quota management in API design?</strong></p>
              <p class="answer">Rate limiting and quota management are used to control how frequently clients can make requests to an API. This prevents abuse, ensures fair access, and protects the backend from being overloaded. Rate limiting is often implemented by defining a maximum number of requests per minute, hour, or day, and can be enforced using tokens or counters stored in memory or a distributed cache like Redis.</p>

            <h3>Set 3</h3>
            <div class="question">
              <p><strong>1. What is the difference between synchronous and asynchronous API calls?</strong></p>
              <p class="answer">In synchronous API calls, the client sends a request and waits for a response before continuing. In asynchronous API calls, the client sends a request and can continue its work while waiting for the response, which will be handled when it's ready. Asynchronous calls improve efficiency and scalability, especially for long-running tasks.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="question">
              <p><strong>2. What is the role of API documentation in API design?</strong></p>
              <p class="answer">API documentation provides developers with detailed instructions on how to interact with an API.

              <p class="answer">Best practices for API versioning include using clear and consistent version identifiers in the URL (e.g., `/api/v1/`), or through custom headers (e.g., `Accept: application/vnd.api.v1+json`). It's important to keep backward compatibility and deprecate older versions gradually while providing clear communication to clients about the changes.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="question">
              <p><strong>4. How do you handle cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) in API design?</strong></p>
              <p class="answer">CORS is a security feature that allows or restricts web applications from making requests to domains other than the one from which the application was loaded. To handle CORS, an API should include appropriate HTTP headers like `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`, `Access-Control-Allow-Methods`, and `Access-Control-Allow-Headers` to specify which domains can interact with it and what methods are allowed.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="question">
              <p><strong>5. What are the advantages of using HTTP status codes in API responses?</strong></p>
              <p class="answer">HTTP status codes provide a standardized way to convey the outcome of an API request. They help clients understand whether a request was successful or encountered an error, and if there was an error, what kind of error occurred. For example, `200 OK` indicates a successful request, while `400 Bad Request` indicates client-side issues.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="question">
              <p><strong>6. What is HATEOAS in REST API design?</strong></p>
              <p class="answer">HATEOAS (Hypermedia as the engine of application state) is a constraint of REST that allows clients to navigate the API dynamically by including links to related resources in API responses. This helps decouple the client from the server and allows the API to evolve over time without breaking existing clients.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="question">

              <p><strong>8. How do you handle pagination in APIs?</strong></p>
              <p class="answer">Pagination is used to divide large sets of data into smaller, more manageable chunks. This can be done using query parameters like `page` and `limit` (or `offset` and `limit`), where `page` specifies the page number and `limit` defines the number of items per page. Another approach is cursor-based pagination, where a cursor (such as an ID) is used to fetch the next set of results.</p>

              <p><strong>4. What is a well-structured URI, and why is it important in API design?</strong></p>
              <p class="answer">A well-structured URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) is essential for creating intuitive, predictable, and RESTful APIs. It should use nouns (representing resources) and HTTP methods (for actions on resources). The URI should be easy to understand, avoid using verbs, and follow a logical hierarchy. Example: `/users/{id}/orders` clearly indicates that we are retrieving orders for a specific user.</p>

              <p><strong>5. How do you handle error responses in an API?</strong></p>
              <p class="answer">Error responses in an API should return meaningful HTTP status codes along with a descriptive error message in the response body. For example, a 400 status code for bad requests should provide details about what went wrong, such as invalid parameters or missing data. It's essential to maintain consistency in error response formats to make troubleshooting easier for clients.</p>

              <p><strong>6. What is the difference between authentication and authorization in API design?</strong></p>
              <p class="answer">Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user or system, typically using credentials such as API keys, tokens, or username/password combinations. Authorization, on the other hand, determines what actions or resources the authenticated user is permitted to access. An API may use both authentication and authorization to ensure secure and controlled access to its resources.</p>

            <div class="question">
              <p><strong>2. How do you handle pagination in an API?</strong></p>
              <p class="answer">Pagination in an API is typically handled by returning a subset of results in each response, along with information about the next and previous pages. This is usually done by including query parameters like `page` and `limit`, or by using `offset` and `count`. The response should also include metadata such as the total number of items, which helps clients understand the extent of the data.</p>

            <div class="question">
              <p><strong>3. What is the role of API versioning?</strong></p>
              <p class="answer">API versioning allows the API provider to make changes and improvements to the API without breaking existing clients. Common methods of versioning include including the version number in the URL (e.g., `/v1/resource`), using request headers (e.g., `Accept: application/vnd.api+json; version=1`), or using query parameters (e.g., `/resource?version=1`). It helps manage backward compatibility.</p>

            <div class="question">
              <p><strong>6. How do you implement API rate limiting?</strong></p>
              <p class="answer">API rate limiting can be implemented using various techniques, such as using HTTP headers to track request counts or setting a time window in which a certain number of requests can be made. A common approach is using a token bucket algorithm or a leaky bucket algorithm, where tokens are generated at a fixed rate, and each request consumes one token. If no tokens are available, the request is rejected until tokens are replenished.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="question">
              <p><strong>7. What is the role of status codes in API design?</strong></p>
              <p class="answer">HTTP status codes provide essential information about the result of an API request. They help clients understand whether the request was successful, if there was an error, or if the server requires further action. Common status codes include 200 (OK), 201 (Created), 400 (Bad Request), 401 (Unauthorized), 404 (Not Found), and 500 (Internal Server Error). Proper use of status codes improves the clarity of API interactions.</p>

            <div class="question">
              <p><strong>8. Why is using HTTPS crucial for API security?</strong></p>
              <p class="answer">HTTPS encrypts data transmitted between the client and server, ensuring that sensitive information such as authentication tokens, user credentials, and personal data are protected from interception or tampering. It also provides integrity, ensuring that the data sent and received has not been altered in transit. Without HTTPS, an API is vulnerable to man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.</p>

            <div class="question">
              <p><strong>9. How do you handle backward compatibility in API design?</strong></p>
              <p class="answer">Backward compatibility is typically managed through versioning, where older versions of the API continue to function alongside new versions. This ensures that existing clients are not broken when the API evolves. Additionally, deprecating endpoints gradually, informing users about breaking changes, and providing clear documentation for migration can help maintain backward compatibility.</p>

            <div class="question">
              <p><strong>10. What is the importance of using meaningful endpoint names?</strong></p>
              <p class="answer">Meaningful endpoint names improve the clarity and usability of an API. They should be descriptive, use nouns (to represent resources), and avoid verbs (which are implied by HTTP methods). For example, `/users/{id}` clearly indicates accessing a user by ID, while `/createUser` would not be appropriate because it mixes the action with the resource. Clear naming helps developers understand the API’s functionality at a glance.</p>

              <p><strong>1. What is the significance of using proper HTTP methods in API design?</strong></p>
              <p class="answer">Using proper HTTP methods ensures that the API adheres to REST principles. For example, `GET` is used to retrieve data, `POST` to create new resources, `PUT` to update entire resources, and `DELETE` to remove resources. Adhering to these conventions leads to clearer, more predictable, and standardized API behavior, improving the overall developer experience and API usability.</p>

            <div class="question">
              <p><strong>2. How would you implement OAuth 2.0 for authentication in your API?</strong></p>
              <p class="answer">To implement OAuth 2.0, the API should have an authorization server that handles token issuance. The server should support flows like Authorization Code Flow for server-side applications or Client Credentials Flow for machine-to-machine communication. The API requires clients to present a valid access token for each request, and the server validates the token before providing access to protected resources.</p>

            <div class="question">
              <p><strong>3. What are the advantages of using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) in API security?</strong></p>
              <p class="answer">JWTs are compact, self-contained tokens that allow API servers to authenticate and authorize requests without needing to store session information. JWTs are signed, making them tamper-proof, and they include all the necessary data to authenticate the user. This eliminates the need for session management on the server side, reducing server load and improving scalability.</p>

            <div class="question">
              <p><strong>4. How do you handle error handling in your API design?</strong></p>
              <p class="answer">Error handling in API design should involve returning standardized error responses with appropriate HTTP status codes, a clear error message, and optional metadata (such as a unique error code). For example, a `400` status code should be returned for client errors, with a message explaining what went wrong. A `500` status code indicates a server-side error. Including additional context, like a stack trace or request ID, can also help with debugging.</p>

            <div class="question">
              <p><strong>6. What is the difference between synchronous and asynchronous APIs?</strong></p>
              <p class="answer">Synchronous APIs process requests in a blocking manner, meaning the client must wait for the server to process the request and return a response. Asynchronous APIs, on the other hand, allow the client to send a request and continue with other operations while waiting for a response. Asynchronous APIs can be more efficient, especially for long-running or resource-intensive processes, as they do not block the client.</p>

              <p><strong>8. What are the key differences between REST and GraphQL APIs?</strong></p>
              <p class="answer">REST APIs use fixed endpoints that return predefined data, while GraphQL APIs allow clients to specify exactly which data they need, reducing over-fetching and under-fetching of data. REST is typically more straightforward to implement, but GraphQL provides more flexibility and efficiency in data retrieval. REST uses HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE, while GraphQL uses a single endpoint and a query language to interact with data.</p>
