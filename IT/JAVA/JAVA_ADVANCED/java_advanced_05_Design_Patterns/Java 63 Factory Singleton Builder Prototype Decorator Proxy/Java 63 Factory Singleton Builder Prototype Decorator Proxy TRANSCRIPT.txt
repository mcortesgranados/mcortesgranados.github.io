1. What is the Factory design pattern?
The Factory design pattern provides a method for creating objects without specifying the exact class of object that will be created. Instead, the factory method delegates the creation to subclasses.

2. What is the Singleton design pattern?
The Singleton pattern ensures that a class has only one instance, and provides a global point of access to it. It is often used to manage shared resources such as a configuration object.

The Builder pattern allows for the construction of complex objects step by step. The pattern is useful for creating objects that need to be configured with many possible options.
        
4. What is the Prototype design pattern?
The Prototype pattern creates new objects by copying an existing object, known as the prototype. This is useful when the creation of an object is costly or complex.

5. What is the Decorator design pattern?
The Decorator pattern allows additional behavior to be added to an object dynamically, without affecting other objects of the same class.

6. What is the Proxy design pattern?
The Proxy pattern provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object. It controls access to the original object and can perform additional actions before or after the request.

7. What are the benefits of the Factory pattern?
The Factory pattern helps to decouple the creation of objects from the client code, provides flexibility, and enables easy addition of new product types.

8. How does the Singleton pattern ensure that only one instance is created?
The Singleton pattern restricts instantiation of a class to a single object and provides a global access point. The instance is created lazily, ensuring that only one instance is used.

9. What is the advantage of the Builder pattern?
The Builder pattern separates the construction of a complex object from its representation. It allows for the creation of objects with different configurations and avoids constructor telescoping.

10. How does the Prototype pattern differ from the Factory pattern?
