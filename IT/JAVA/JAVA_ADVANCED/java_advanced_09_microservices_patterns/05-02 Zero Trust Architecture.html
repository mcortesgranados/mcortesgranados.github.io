        <h1>Zero Trust Architecture</h1>

        <h2>What is Zero Trust Architecture?</h2>
        <p>Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA) is a security model that requires strict identity verification for every user and device attempting to access resources in a network. The core principle of Zero Trust is "never trust, always verify." Regardless of whether the request comes from inside or outside the network, it is treated as untrusted until it is explicitly verified.</p>

        <h2>How Zero Trust Architecture Works:</h2>
        <div class="steps">
            <div class="step">1. **Identify and Authenticate**: Every service, device, and user is authenticated and identified before any access is granted.</div>
            <div class="step">2. **Continuous Monitoring**: Access is continuously monitored and verified to ensure that only authorized entities can interact with the system.</div>
            <div class="step">3. **Least Privilege Access**: Users and services are granted the minimum level of access needed to perform their tasks, reducing the potential impact of a security breach.</div>
            <div class="step">4. **Micro-Segmentation**: The network is divided into small, secure segments to prevent lateral movement of threats in case of a breach.</div>
            <div class="step">5. **Verification of Every Request**: Every request made by a user or service is verified through continuous authentication, not relying solely on initial trust.</div>
        </div>

        <h2>Benefits of Zero Trust Architecture:</h2>
        <div class="benefits">
            <ul>
                <li>üîê **Enhanced Security** ‚Äì By verifying identities and continuously monitoring access, Zero Trust minimizes the attack surface and limits the scope of a potential breach.</li>
                <li>‚ö° **Reduced Risk** ‚Äì Even if an attacker gains access to a part of the system, Zero Trust's principles of least privilege and micro-segmentation limit the damage they can cause.</li>
                <li>üöÄ **Scalable and Flexible** ‚Äì Zero Trust works well for modern, distributed systems, including cloud-based environments and hybrid infrastructures.</li>
                <li>üõ°Ô∏è **Resilience Against Insider Threats** ‚Äì Since trust is never assumed, even internal threats are detected and prevented through constant verification.</li>
                <li>üîç **Improved Visibility and Monitoring** ‚Äì All access requests are logged and monitored, allowing for better visibility into the network and earlier detection of suspicious activities.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>Example Use Case:</h2>
        <p class="example">In a **financial services company**, Zero Trust Architecture ensures that each request for access to sensitive financial data is authenticated and authorized, regardless of whether the user is within the corporate network or accessing from an external device. This helps to secure data even if one part of the system is compromised.</p>

        <h2>Simulate Zero Trust Access Control</h2>
        <p>Click below to simulate an access request verification process:</p>
        <button onclick="simulateZeroTrust()">Simulate Zero Trust Access</button>
        <div id="status"></div>
    </div>

    <script>
        function simulateZeroTrust() {
            const statusDiv = document.getElementById("status");
            statusDiv.innerHTML = "üîÑ Verifying Identity...";

            setTimeout(() => {
                statusDiv.innerHTML = "‚úÖ Identity Verified!";
            }, 2000); // Simulate identity verification

            setTimeout(() => {
                statusDiv.innerHTML = "üîê Checking Access Permissions...";
            }, 4000); // Simulate access permissions check

            setTimeout(() => {
                statusDiv.innerHTML = "üõ°Ô∏è Monitoring Access...";
            }, 6000); // Simulate continuous access monitoring

            setTimeout(() => {
                statusDiv.innerHTML = "‚úÖ Access Granted!";
            }, 8000); // Simulate granting access
        }
