Q1: What is the difference between Feign and RestTemplate in Spring?
Feign is a declarative web service client that integrates with Spring Cloud, allowing you to create HTTP clients with annotations. RestTemplate, on the other hand, is a more traditional Spring-based approach for making HTTP requests to remote services. Feign is typically easier to use and less boilerplate-heavy than RestTemplate.

Q2: How do you use RestTemplate to call a REST API in Java?
In RestTemplate, you can use the getForObject() or postForObject() methods to call a REST API. You need to create a RestTemplate bean, which will be used for communication with the API.

Q3: How does WebClient differ from RestTemplate in Spring?
WebClient is the non-blocking, reactive alternative to RestTemplate. It supports asynchronous communication and allows for a more efficient handling of requests, especially in reactive applications. RestTemplate is blocking and synchronous, while WebClient provides better scalability and performance in modern applications.

Q4: What are the advantages of using Feign in microservice architectures?
Feign simplifies service-to-service communication by providing declarative HTTP client interfaces. It reduces boilerplate code, integrates well with Spring Cloud, and automatically handles error responses, retries, and load balancing when used with Spring Cloud Netflix (Eureka, Ribbon). It also supports configuration via annotations, making it easier to maintain and modify.

Q5: How do you handle error responses with RestTemplate in Java?
In RestTemplate, you can handle error responses by using an HttpErrorHandler or catching exceptions such as HttpClientErrorException and HttpServerErrorException to capture and process error details.

Q6: How do you create a Feign client in Spring Boot?
To create a Feign client in Spring Boot, you need to annotate your interface with @FeignClient and provide the service name. You can then define the endpoints in the interface using Spring MVC annotations such as @RequestMapping.

Q7: How do you perform asynchronous HTTP requests with WebClient in Spring?
WebClient supports asynchronous HTTP requests using Mono and Flux types. You can perform an asynchronous request by invoking the retrieve() method and handling the response asynchronously using subscribe().

Q8: How do you configure timeouts for WebClient in Spring?
You can configure timeouts for WebClient by using a custom ClientHttpConnector that applies connection and response timeouts. This is typically done with ReactorNettyHttpClient in Spring WebFlux.

Q9: What is the purpose of the @RequestMapping annotation in Feign?
The @RequestMapping annotation in Feign is used to map a method in the Feign client interface to a REST endpoint. It specifies the HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and the URL path for the request.

Q10: How do you configure a custom error handler in RestTemplate?
You can configure a custom error handler by implementing the ResponseErrorHandler interface and setting it on a RestTemplate instance using setErrorHandler().

Q11: What is the benefit of using WebClient for service-to-service communication?
WebClient provides several benefits, such as support for non-blocking, reactive programming. It can handle large-scale, concurrent requests with better performance, as it allows for asynchronous communication and is ideal for reactive applications.

Q12: How can you use Feign with Spring Cloud for service discovery?
You can use Feign with Spring Cloud by combining it with a service discovery tool like Eureka. Feign will automatically resolve service names through the service registry to communicate with other services in the system.

Q13: What is the difference between Mono and Flux in WebClient?
Mono is a reactive type that represents a single or empty asynchronous value. Flux is used for representing a sequence of asynchronous values. WebClient uses these types to handle single or multiple responses from a service.

Q14: How do you handle retries in Feign clients?
You can enable automatic retries in Feign by using Spring Cloud Netflix's Retryer class. You can configure the retry policy using the @FeignClient annotation.
