1. What is the Saga pattern in microservices?
The Saga pattern is a sequence of transactions that updates each microservice and publishes events to trigger the next transaction. If any step fails, a compensating transaction is executed.

2. What are the two types of Saga implementations?
The two types of Saga implementations are:

Event Sourcing is a pattern where the state of an application is stored as a sequence of events instead of the current state. The state is rebuilt by replaying these events.

5. How does Spring Boot support the Saga pattern?
