<h1>Set 1: Spring Boot Microservices Patterns (Saga, CQRS, Event Sourcing)</h1>
<div class="question">
  <h2>1. What is the Saga pattern in microservices?</h2>
  <p>The Saga pattern is a sequence of transactions that updates each microservice and publishes events to trigger the next transaction. If any step fails, a compensating transaction is executed.</p>
</div>
<div class="question">
  <h2>2. What are the two types of Saga implementations?</h2>
  <p>The two types of Saga implementations are:<br>
    - **Choreography**: Each service listens for events and decides the next action.<br>
    - **Orchestration**: A centralized orchestrator manages the Saga flow.</p>
</div>
<div class="question">
  <h2>3. How does CQRS help in microservices?</h2>
  <p>CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) separates read and write operations, improving performance, scalability, and security by using different models for querying and updating data.</p>
</div>
<div class="question">
  <h2>4. What is Event Sourcing?</h2>
  <p>Event Sourcing is a pattern where the state of an application is stored as a sequence of events instead of the current state. The state is rebuilt by replaying these events.</p>
</div>
<div class="question">
  <h2>5. How does Spring Boot support the Saga pattern?</h2>
  <p>Spring Boot supports Saga through frameworks like **Axon Framework**, **Camunda**, and **Spring Cloud Data Flow**, which help in orchestrating and managing distributed transactions.</p>

</div>
<div class="question">

</div>
<div class="question">
  <h2>15. How does the Choreography-based Saga pattern work?</h2>

  <h2>16. What are the disadvantages of Choreography-based Saga?</h2>
  <p>- Difficult to track and debug due to distributed nature.<br>
    - Increases event complexity as the number of services grows.<br>
    - Harder to maintain consistency across services.</p>
</div>
<div class="question">
  <h2>17. How does the Orchestration-based Saga pattern work?</h2>
  <p>In an Orchestration-based Saga, a central service (Saga Orchestrator) coordinates transaction steps, calling each microservice and handling compensations if needed.</p>
