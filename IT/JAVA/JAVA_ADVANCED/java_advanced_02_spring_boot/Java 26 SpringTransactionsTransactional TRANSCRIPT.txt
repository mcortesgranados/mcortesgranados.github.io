1. What is a transaction in the context of Spring?
In the context of Spring, a transaction is a set of operations that are executed as a single unit of work. A transaction ensures that either all operations are successfully completed, or none of them are, maintaining the integrity of the data.

2. What is the role of the @Transactional annotation in Spring?
The @Transactional annotation is used to define a method or class that should be executed within a transaction context. It ensures that the operations within the method are atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable (ACID properties).

3. What are the default propagation and isolation levels in Spring's @Transactional?
By default, the propagation level in Spring's @Transactional is PROPAGATION_REQUIRED, meaning it will join an existing transaction if one exists or create a new one if necessary. The isolation level is set to ISOLATION_DEFAULT, which uses the database's default isolation level.

4. What is the difference between PROPAGATION_REQUIRED and PROPAGATION_REQUIRES_NEW?
PROPAGATION_REQUIRED means the method will join an existing transaction if one exists, or a new transaction will be started if none exists. PROPAGATION_REQUIRES_NEW, on the other hand, always creates a new transaction and suspends any existing transaction.

5. How do isolation levels affect transactions in Spring?
Isolation levels define the degree of visibility one transaction has to the data being modified by other concurrent transactions. Higher isolation levels reduce concurrency but ensure greater consistency, while lower isolation levels improve performance but risk dirty reads or non-repeatable reads. Common isolation levels include READ_UNCOMMITTED, READ_COMMITTED, REPEATABLE_READ, and SERIALIZABLE.

6. What is the default rollback behavior in Spring’s @Transactional?
By default, Spring rolls back a transaction only on unchecked exceptions (i.e., subclasses of RuntimeException) or errors (e.g., Throwable). To customize this behavior, you can use the rollbackFor attribute of @Transactional to specify the exceptions that should trigger a rollback.

7. What is the difference between @Transactional on a method and @Transactional on a class?
When @Transactional is applied at the method level, it applies only to that specific method. When applied at the class level, all methods within the class inherit the transaction behavior unless overridden at the method level.

8. How can you prevent a rollback in Spring if a specific exception occurs?
You can prevent rollback by using the noRollbackFor attribute in the @Transactional annotation. This attribute specifies the exceptions for which no rollback should occur, even if they are unchecked exceptions.

9. What is the difference between @Transactional and manual transaction management?
@Transactional automates transaction management using AOP (Aspect-Oriented Programming), whereas manual transaction management requires explicitly starting, committing, or rolling back transactions in the code using PlatformTransactionManager.

10. What is the use of @Transactional(readOnly = true)?
The @Transactional(readOnly = true) annotation is used to mark a method as read-only, which indicates that no changes will be made to the database during the transaction. This can be used to optimize the performance of queries, as some databases might be able to use specific optimizations when no updates are being performed.

1. What happens when a method annotated with @Transactional throws an exception?
When a method annotated with @Transactional throws an exception, the transaction is automatically rolled back. By default, this happens for unchecked exceptions (subclasses of RuntimeException) or errors, but can be customized using rollbackFor or noRollbackFor attributes.

2. What is the purpose of the timeout attribute in the @Transactional annotation?
The timeout attribute defines the maximum time (in seconds) that a transaction can run. If the transaction exceeds this time, it will be automatically rolled back. This can be useful for preventing long-running transactions from blocking other operations.

3. Can @Transactional be used in a read-only method with Spring Data JPA?
Yes, @Transactional can be used with Spring Data JPA in a read-only method. When @Transactional(readOnly = true) is applied, it tells Spring that no changes will be made to the database, and it may optimize the underlying query execution for better performance.

4. What is the impact of using the @Transactional annotation with a non-transactional method?
If @Transactional is applied to a non-transactional method, it will not initiate a new transaction. Spring will attempt to join an existing transaction if one exists, or no transaction will be created if none exists. This might lead to unexpected behavior if the method performs actions that require a transaction.

5. How do you handle transaction propagation in Spring?
In Spring, transaction propagation determines how transactions behave when calling a method that is also annotated with @Transactional. Propagation options include PROPAGATION_REQUIRED, PROPAGATION_REQUIRES_NEW, PROPAGATION_SUPPORTS, etc., allowing you to control whether to join an existing transaction or create a new one.

6. What is the use of @Transactional(propagation = Propagation.NOT_SUPPORTED)?
The PROPAGATION_NOT_SUPPORTED setting tells Spring to suspend any existing transaction and execute the method outside of a transaction. This is useful for methods that do not need transactional support, and it can improve performance by avoiding unnecessary transaction management.

7. How can you test a method annotated with @Transactional?
To test a method annotated with @Transactional, you can use Spring's testing support. Typically, you would use @Transactional in a test class and configure your test database to allow rollback after each test method. This ensures that database changes made during tests do not persist after the test completes.

8. What is the difference between @Transactional and @EnableTransactionManagement?
@Transactional is used to mark methods that should be run within a transaction, whereas @EnableTransactionManagement is a class-level annotation that enables Spring’s annotation-driven transaction management. The latter is typically used in configuration classes to enable transaction management.

9. Can @Transactional be used with multiple data sources?
Yes, @Transactional can be used with multiple data sources by using the @Transactional annotation along with specific configuration to handle each data source's transaction separately or within a single, distributed transaction (if using technologies like Atomikos or Spring's JTA support).

10. How do you configure the isolation level in @Transactional?
The isolation level in @Transactional can be configured using the isolation attribute. Common isolation levels include ISOLATION_DEFAULT, ISOLATION_READ_UNCOMMITTED, ISOLATION_READ_COMMITTED, ISOLATION_REPEATABLE_READ, and ISOLATION_SERIALIZABLE, which define how transactions are isolated from each other to prevent concurrency issues.

1. What happens when a method annotated with @Transactional is called from within the same class?
If a method annotated with @Transactional is called from within the same class, the transactional behavior does not apply. This is because Spring’s AOP proxy mechanism only applies to method calls from external clients. To make it work, you need to call the method from a different instance, or use a separate class for the transactional methods.

2. What is the default behavior for transaction rollback in Spring?
By default, Spring rolls back transactions only for unchecked exceptions (subclasses of RuntimeException) and errors. To roll back for checked exceptions, you need to specify the rollbackFor attribute in the @Transactional annotation.

3. Can the @Transactional annotation be applied to private methods?
No, the @Transactional annotation cannot be applied to private methods because Spring's proxy-based mechanism requires the method to be visible to the proxy. If a method is private, it is not accessible to the proxy, and the transaction management will not work.

4. How does Spring handle transaction commit and rollback?
Spring handles transaction commit and rollback automatically. If a method annotated with @Transactional completes without errors, the transaction is committed. If an exception is thrown, the transaction is rolled back. You can customize this behavior using the rollbackFor or noRollbackFor attributes in @Transactional.

5. What is the difference between PROPAGATION_REQUIRED and PROPAGATION_REQUIRES_NEW?
PROPAGATION_REQUIRED is the default propagation type. It means the method must run within a transaction; if there is no existing transaction, it creates a new one. On the other hand, PROPAGATION_REQUIRES_NEW suspends any existing transaction and creates a new, independent transaction.

6. What is readOnly attribute in @Transactional?
The readOnly attribute in @Transactional is used to specify that a method will not modify the database. It helps to optimize database operations for read-only transactions, improving performance by preventing unnecessary locks and enabling certain optimizations in the database.

7. What is the difference between PROPAGATION_SUPPORTS and PROPAGATION_NOT_SUPPORTED?
PROPAGATION_SUPPORTS allows the method to run within a transaction if one exists, but does not require a transaction. PROPAGATION_NOT_SUPPORTED suspends any existing transaction and runs the method outside of a transaction, ensuring that no transaction is active during the method execution.

8. What does the @Transactional annotation do in a multi-threaded environment?
In a multi-threaded environment, each thread has its own transaction context. Spring manages transactions on a per-thread basis, ensuring that each thread has a separate transaction. This is important to prevent conflicts and ensure data consistency across multiple threads.

9. Can @Transactional be used with methods that are part of a service layer?
Yes, @Transactional is commonly used in service layer methods to ensure that the operations within the service are performed within a transaction. It helps to abstract the transaction management from the controller and repository layers, simplifying the codebase.

10. What is the purpose of @EnableTransactionManagement in Spring?
The @EnableTransactionManagement annotation is used to enable annotation-driven transaction management in Spring. It allows Spring to automatically manage transactions based on the @Transactional annotation and other related settings in the application context configuration.

1. What happens when a method annotated with @Transactional throws a checked exception?
By default, Spring does not roll back a transaction when a checked exception is thrown. You can configure Spring to roll back for checked exceptions using the rollbackFor attribute of the @Transactional annotation.

2. What is the timeout attribute in @Transactional used for?
The timeout attribute specifies the maximum amount of time (in seconds) that a transaction is allowed to run before it is automatically rolled back. If the transaction exceeds the specified timeout, a TransactionTimedOutException is thrown, and the transaction is rolled back.

3. How does Spring manage database connections in a transaction?
Spring manages database connections through a DataSource and uses a Connection object to execute database operations within a transaction. The connection is automatically bound to the current transaction, and it is either committed or rolled back based on the outcome of the transaction.

4. Can @Transactional be used on a constructor?
No, the @Transactional annotation cannot be used on a constructor. Spring only supports annotation-based transaction management on methods, not constructors, because transaction management is tied to method invocation.

5. What is the isolation attribute in @Transactional used for?
The isolation attribute specifies the isolation level of a transaction. Isolation levels determine how data is locked and accessed by concurrent transactions. Common isolation levels include READ_COMMITTED, REPEATABLE_READ, and SERIALIZABLE, with READ_COMMITTED being the default.

6. What is the difference between PROPAGATION_REQUIRED and PROPAGATION_MANDATORY?
PROPAGATION_REQUIRED means that the method must run within a transaction, and if no transaction exists, a new one is created. PROPAGATION_MANDATORY means that the method must run within an existing transaction; if no transaction exists, an exception is thrown.

7. What does @Transactional do when a transaction is rolled back?
When a transaction is rolled back, all the changes made during the transaction are undone, ensuring that the database remains consistent. Any changes made to the database are discarded, and the transaction state is reverted to what it was before the method execution started.

8. How can you handle nested transactions in Spring?
You can handle nested transactions in Spring by using the PROPAGATION_REQUIRES_NEW propagation type. This ensures that each nested transaction runs in its own independent transaction, which can either commit or roll back without affecting the parent transaction.

9. Can @Transactional be used in a read-only database context?
Yes, @Transactional can be used in a read-only database context. You can set the readOnly attribute of the annotation to true to indicate that the method will only read data and will not modify the database. This helps optimize database operations for read-only transactions.

10. What is a transaction manager in Spring?
A transaction manager in Spring is responsible for managing the lifecycle of transactions. It coordinates transaction boundaries (begin, commit, and rollback) and integrates with the underlying database or transactional system. Examples include DataSourceTransactionManager for JDBC transactions and JpaTransactionManager for JPA-based transactions.

1. What is the default transaction propagation setting in Spring?
The default propagation setting in Spring is PROPAGATION_REQUIRED. This means that if a transaction exists, the method will participate in that transaction; if no transaction exists, a new one will be created.

2. How does Spring manage transactions in case of a rollback?
When a transaction is rolled back, Spring automatically undoes all changes made during the transaction by invoking the rollback on the underlying transactional resources (such as JDBC or JPA). It ensures that the system remains in a consistent state.

3. Can we use @Transactional with a method that does not return any value?
Yes, @Transactional can be used with a method that does not return any value. The annotation is focused on managing the transaction itself, not the return type of the method.

4. What is the difference between PROPAGATION_NESTED and PROPAGATION_REQUIRES_NEW?
PROPAGATION_NESTED allows for nested transactions, where the inner transaction can be rolled back independently of the outer transaction. PROPAGATION_REQUIRES_NEW, on the other hand, creates a completely new transaction that suspends any existing transaction.

5. What happens if a method annotated with @Transactional throws a runtime exception?
By default, Spring will roll back the transaction when a runtime exception (unchecked exception) is thrown. If the exception is not a runtime exception, the transaction will not be rolled back unless explicitly configured with the rollbackFor attribute.

6. How can you configure Spring to roll back on specific exceptions?
You can use the rollbackFor attribute of the @Transactional annotation to specify which exceptions should trigger a rollback. For example, @Transactional(rollbackFor = MyException.class) will roll back the transaction if MyException is thrown.

7. How do you define the isolation level for a Spring transaction?
You can define the isolation level for a Spring transaction using the isolation attribute of the @Transactional annotation. The common isolation levels are READ_UNCOMMITTED, READ_COMMITTED, REPEATABLE_READ, and SERIALIZABLE.

8. How can we prevent Spring from rolling back a transaction for specific exceptions?
You can prevent Spring from rolling back for specific exceptions using the noRollbackFor attribute of the @Transactional annotation. For example, @Transactional(noRollbackFor = MyException.class) will ensure that the transaction is not rolled back for MyException.

9. Can we use @Transactional for multiple methods in the same class?
Yes, @Transactional can be applied to multiple methods within the same class. Each method will inherit the transactional behavior as specified by the annotation.

10. How does Spring's transaction management support declarative transactions?
Spring's transaction management supports declarative transactions by using the @Transactional annotation or XML configuration. The framework creates a proxy that manages the transaction boundaries (begin, commit, rollback) for the annotated methods, allowing for automatic transaction management without the need for explicit code.

1. What is the significance of the @Transactional annotation?
The @Transactional annotation in Spring is used to define transaction boundaries. It automatically manages transactions, ensuring that methods run within a transaction, and can roll back the transaction in case of a failure.

2. Can the @Transactional annotation be applied to classes?
Yes, @Transactional can be applied to classes as well. If applied at the class level, it affects all the methods within that class unless overridden at the method level.

3. What does the isolation attribute in the @Transactional annotation do?
The isolation attribute in @Transactional specifies the isolation level of the transaction, which determines how transaction modifications are isolated from other concurrent transactions. Common values include READ_COMMITTED, READ_UNCOMMITTED, REPEATABLE_READ, and SERIALIZABLE.

4. What are the default rollback behavior and conditions for Spring transactions?
By default, Spring only rolls back a transaction for unchecked exceptions (i.e., RuntimeException and Error). For checked exceptions, you must explicitly configure rollback behavior using the rollbackFor attribute.

5. What is the PROPAGATION_REQUIRES_NEW propagation level in Spring transactions?
PROPAGATION_REQUIRES_NEW ensures that a new transaction is created for the method, and any existing transaction will be suspended while the new transaction runs. After the new transaction completes, the original transaction will resume.

6. How can we apply @Transactional to non-public methods?
You can apply @Transactional to non-public methods (such as private or protected) as long as the method is accessed through a proxy (i.e., it is called from another method within the same class or externally). However, Spring will only create proxies for public methods by default.

7. What does the readOnly attribute in @Transactional do?
The readOnly attribute in @Transactional is used to mark a transaction as read-only. This informs the transaction manager that no modifications will be made to the database during the transaction, which may optimize performance for read-only operations.

8. What are the different transaction propagation levels in Spring?
Spring provides several transaction propagation levels:

PROPAGATION_REQUIRED: Supports a current transaction or creates a new one.
PROPAGATION_SUPPORTS: Participates in an existing transaction or runs without a transaction if none exists.
PROPAGATION_MANDATORY: Supports an existing transaction; throws an exception if no transaction exists.
PROPAGATION_REQUIRES_NEW: Suspends the current transaction and starts a new one.
PROPAGATION_NOT_SUPPORTED: Suspends the current transaction and runs without a transaction.
PROPAGATION_NEVER: Executes without a transaction; throws an exception if a transaction exists.
PROPAGATION_NESTED: Executes within a nested transaction if a current transaction exists.

9. Can we use @Transactional in a multi-threaded environment?
Yes, @Transactional can be used in a multi-threaded environment, but it requires careful management to ensure that each thread has its own transaction. Spring creates separate transactions for each thread based on the execution context.

10. What is the purpose of the @EnableTransactionManagement annotation in Spring?
The @EnableTransactionManagement annotation is used to enable annotation-driven transaction management in Spring. It allows the use of @Transactional and ensures that the appropriate proxy is created to manage the transaction lifecycle.

1. What is the timeout attribute in @Transactional used for?
The timeout attribute in @Transactional defines the maximum time (in seconds) a transaction can run before it times out. If the transaction exceeds this time, it will be automatically rolled back.

2. How does Spring handle nested transactions with the @Transactional annotation?
Spring supports nested transactions using the PROPAGATION_NESTED propagation level. A nested transaction allows you to commit or roll back changes within a part of a transaction without affecting the outer transaction.

3. What is the difference between @Transactional on a method and on a class?
Applying @Transactional to a method means that only that method will be wrapped in a transaction. When applied to a class, it applies the transaction management to all methods in the class unless overridden at the method level. Method-level annotations take precedence.

4. Can you control the rollback behavior in Spring for different exceptions?
Yes, you can control rollback behavior in Spring by using the rollbackFor and noRollbackFor attributes in the @Transactional annotation. You can specify which exceptions should trigger a rollback and which ones should not.

5. How can Spring Transaction management handle database connections in a clustered environment?
In a clustered environment, Spring Transaction management ensures that database connections are handled correctly using appropriate transaction managers for the specific database configuration. It can manage transactions in a distributed system by using JTA (Java Transaction API) for coordination across multiple resources.

6. What is the readOnly flag in @Transactional and when should it be used?
The readOnly flag in @Transactional is set to true when you know that a transaction will only be reading from the database and not performing any updates. It helps optimize the transaction, especially for database connections, as certain database systems may optimize read-only transactions for better performance.

7. What is the behavior when a method annotated with @Transactional calls another method that is also annotated with @Transactional?
By default, when a method annotated with @Transactional calls another method that is also annotated with @Transactional, the caller method will use the same transaction. If the propagation setting is set to PROPAGATION_REQUIRES_NEW in the second method, it will start a new transaction.

8. What is @Transactional's behavior with respect to exception handling?
By default, Spring will only roll back a transaction for unchecked exceptions (i.e., RuntimeException) and errors. For checked exceptions, you need to explicitly specify that you want a rollback using the rollbackFor attribute of the @Transactional annotation.

9. Can @Transactional be used in Spring Boot applications?
Yes, @Transactional can be used in Spring Boot applications. Spring Boot automatically configures transaction management if the @EnableTransactionManagement annotation is added (which is typically done automatically in most cases). You can use @Transactional on methods to manage transactions.

10. How can you prevent a transaction from rolling back in certain cases in Spring?
You can use the noRollbackFor attribute in @Transactional to specify exceptions that should not trigger a rollback. This allows you to prevent the transaction from being rolled back for certain types of exceptions.

1. What is the difference between PROPAGATION_REQUIRED and PROPAGATION_REQUIRES_NEW?
PROPAGATION_REQUIRED means that the method must run within an existing transaction. If there is no current transaction, a new one will be created. PROPAGATION_REQUIRES_NEW forces the method to always run in a new transaction, suspending any existing transaction.

2. How can you ensure that a transaction is rolled back only on specific exceptions?
You can control the rollback behavior using the rollbackFor and noRollbackFor attributes of the @Transactional annotation. rollbackFor specifies exceptions that should trigger a rollback, while noRollbackFor specifies exceptions that should not trigger a rollback.

3. What is @EnableTransactionManagement and why is it used?
@EnableTransactionManagement is an annotation that enables annotation-driven transaction management in Spring. It allows you to use @Transactional in your code, and it configures a transaction manager for managing transactions. In Spring Boot, it is enabled by default.

4. What is the default behavior of Spring’s transaction management in terms of commit and rollback?
By default, Spring will commit a transaction if no runtime exception (unchecked exception) occurs. If an unchecked exception occurs, Spring will automatically roll back the transaction. For checked exceptions, you need to specify explicitly if you want a rollback using rollbackFor.

5. What is the isolation attribute in @Transactional?
The isolation attribute in @Transactional defines the level of isolation for a transaction. It controls how the transaction interacts with other concurrent transactions. The options are READ_UNCOMMITTED, READ_COMMITTED, REPEATABLE_READ, and SERIALIZABLE.

6. What are some potential issues when using @Transactional with multiple database resources?
When using @Transactional with multiple databases, you may encounter issues with distributed transactions, such as managing consistency and handling failures across different data sources. Using JTA (Java Transaction API) or other distributed transaction managers can help mitigate these issues.

7. How does Spring handle the transaction commit process?
Spring handles the commit process automatically after the method annotated with @Transactional successfully completes. If the method executes without throwing a rollback exception, Spring commits the transaction. If an exception occurs, the transaction is rolled back.

8. How does the readOnly flag in @Transactional improve performance?
Setting the readOnly flag to true tells Spring that the transaction will only perform read operations. This allows Spring to optimize the transaction by skipping certain operations like locking and flushing the persistence context, improving performance in read-heavy transactions.

9. Can you use @Transactional for both read-only and read-write transactions?
Yes, you can use @Transactional for both read-only and read-write transactions. For read-only transactions, you can set the readOnly attribute to true. For read-write transactions, the default is false, which allows modifying data in the transaction.

10. What is the role of the TransactionManager in Spring’s transaction management?
The TransactionManager in Spring is responsible for managing the transaction lifecycle. It coordinates the transaction, including starting, committing, or rolling back the transaction based on the outcome of the operation. The PlatformTransactionManager is the main interface used by Spring for transaction management.

1. What are the main types of transaction propagation in Spring?
The main types of transaction propagation in Spring are: PROPAGATION_REQUIRED, PROPAGATION_REQUIRES_NEW, PROPAGATION_NESTED, PROPAGATION_SUPPORTS, PROPAGATION_MANDATORY, PROPAGATION_NOT_SUPPORTED, and PROPAGATION_NEVER.

2. What is the significance of the @Transactional annotation in Spring?
The @Transactional annotation is used to define transaction boundaries for methods in Spring. It provides declarative transaction management, ensuring that the method runs within a transaction, and handles commit or rollback based on the outcome of the method.

3. How do you define a read-only transaction in Spring?
You can define a read-only transaction by setting the readOnly attribute in the @Transactional annotation to true. This optimizes performance for transactions that only involve read operations and prevents accidental data modifications.

4. What happens if you mark a method as @Transactional and it throws an exception?
By default, if a method marked with @Transactional throws a runtime exception (unchecked exception), the transaction will be rolled back. If it throws a checked exception, the transaction will not be rolled back unless explicitly specified using the rollbackFor attribute.

5. Can you use multiple @Transactional annotations on different methods in a single class?
Yes, you can use multiple @Transactional annotations on different methods in a class. Each method will have its own transaction boundary, with the properties defined in the annotation applying to that method.

6. How does Spring handle the rollback of a transaction in case of an exception?
Spring will automatically roll back the transaction if a runtime exception is thrown, unless explicitly specified not to do so. For checked exceptions, you need to specify the rollback behavior using the rollbackFor attribute in the @Transactional annotation.

7. How can you configure transaction management programmatically in Spring?
Transaction management can be configured programmatically by creating a PlatformTransactionManager bean and using it with the TransactionTemplate to manage transactions in your code manually.

8. What is the role of TransactionSynchronization in Spring transactions?
TransactionSynchronization allows you to register synchronization callbacks with the transaction. These callbacks can be executed during transaction commit or rollback, giving you more control over transaction-related actions.

9. What is the difference between PROPAGATION_REQUIRED and PROPAGATION_NESTED?
PROPAGATION_REQUIRED ensures that a new transaction is created only if no existing transaction is present. If an existing transaction exists, it participates in it. On the other hand, PROPAGATION_NESTED allows the current method to execute within a nested transaction, meaning it can roll back independently from the outer transaction.

10. How does @Transactional interact with Spring AOP?
Spring uses AOP (Aspect-Oriented Programming) to apply the @Transactional annotation. It creates a proxy for the target method and intercepts the method calls to manage transactions. The proxy handles transaction start, commit, and rollback based on method execution.

1. What is the difference between programmatic and declarative transaction management in Spring?
Programmatic transaction management involves explicitly managing the transaction in your code by using the PlatformTransactionManager. In contrast, declarative transaction management uses annotations like @Transactional or XML configurations, allowing Spring to automatically manage the transaction boundaries based on method execution.

2. What are the implications of using @Transactional with Propagation.REQUIRES_NEW?
When using PROPAGATION_REQUIRES_NEW, a new transaction will always be created, regardless of whether an existing transaction is already in progress. If there is an ongoing transaction, it will be suspended, and the new transaction will run independently. After the new transaction completes, the suspended transaction will resume.

3. How does Spring handle the rollback of transactions for different types of exceptions?
By default, Spring only rolls back transactions for runtime (unchecked) exceptions. However, you can configure the rollback behavior for checked (or any other) exceptions by specifying the rollbackFor attribute in the @Transactional annotation. For example, @Transactional(rollbackFor = Exception.class) will roll back the transaction for any exception.

4. What is the default behavior of Spring's transaction management regarding rollback?
By default, Spring only rolls back transactions for unchecked exceptions (i.e., subclasses of RuntimeException) and errors (i.e., subclasses of Error). If a checked exception is thrown, the transaction will not be rolled back unless the rollback behavior is explicitly configured using the rollbackFor or noRollbackFor attributes in the @Transactional annotation.

5. Can you specify rollback behavior for specific exceptions using @Transactional?
Yes, you can specify the rollback behavior for specific exceptions by using the rollbackFor attribute in the @Transactional annotation. You can list one or more exception classes that should trigger a rollback, e.g., @Transactional(rollbackFor = SQLException.class).

6. What is a nested transaction, and how does PROPAGATION_NESTED work?
A nested transaction is a transaction within another transaction, which allows the inner transaction to commit or roll back independently of the outer transaction. With PROPAGATION_NESTED, Spring starts a new savepoint within the existing transaction. If the nested transaction fails, the changes made by the inner transaction can be rolled back, but the outer transaction can still proceed.

7. How do you handle transaction isolation in Spring?
Transaction isolation can be configured using the isolation attribute of the @Transactional annotation. You can specify one of the following isolation levels: ISOLATION_DEFAULT, ISOLATION_READ_COMMITTED, ISOLATION_READ_UNCOMMITTED, ISOLATION_REPEATABLE_READ, or ISOLATION_SERIALIZABLE. The isolation level defines how concurrent transactions interact with each other.

8. What is the @Transactional propagation behavior for PROPAGATION_SUPPORTS?
With PROPAGATION_SUPPORTS, the method will run within the context of an existing transaction if one exists. If no transaction exists, the method will execute without a transaction. This propagation is typically used when the method does not require a transaction, but should participate in one if available.

9. How do you prevent a transaction from being rolled back in Spring?
You can prevent a transaction from being rolled back by using the @Transactional annotation's noRollbackFor attribute. For example, @Transactional(noRollbackFor = SQLException.class) will prevent rollback for SQLException even if it's thrown during the method execution.

10. What are the advantages of using declarative transaction management in Spring?
The advantages of declarative transaction management include separation of business logic and transaction management, ease of configuration, better readability, and less boilerplate code. It allows you to focus on the core logic without worrying about transaction management details, making your code more maintainable and modular.
