<h1 class="style1">Set 1: Spring Boot Microservices Patterns (Saga, CQRS, Event Sourcing)</h1>
<h2 class="style1"><a href="Java 33 Microservices Patterns Saga CQRS Event Sourcing 01.mp3" target="_blank">Audio 1</a></h2>
<div class="style2">
  <h2>1. What is the Saga pattern in microservices?</h2>
  <p>The Saga pattern is a sequence of transactions that updates each microservice and publishes events to trigger the next transaction. If any step fails, a compensating transaction is executed.</p>
</div>
<div class="style2">
  <h2>2. What are the two types of Saga implementations?</h2>
  <p>The two types of Saga implementations are:<br>
    - **Choreography**: Each service listens for events and decides the next action.<br>
    - **Orchestration**: A centralized orchestrator manages the Saga flow.</p>
</div>
<div class="style2">
  <h2>3. How does CQRS help in microservices?</h2>
  <p>CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) separates read and write operations, improving performance, scalability, and security by using different models for querying and updating data.</p>
</div>
<div class="style2">
  <h2>4. What is Event Sourcing?</h2>
  <p>Event Sourcing is a pattern where the state of an application is stored as a sequence of events instead of the current state. The state is rebuilt by replaying these events.</p>
</div>
<div class="style2">
  <h2>5. How does Spring Boot support the Saga pattern?</h2>
  <p>Spring Boot supports Saga through frameworks like **Axon Framework**, **Camunda**, and **Spring Cloud Data Flow**, which help in orchestrating and managing distributed transactions.</p>

  <h2>6. What are the advantages of using CQRS?</h2>
  <p>- Improves system scalability by separating read and write models.<br>
    - Optimizes query performance.<br>
    - Allows using different databases for read and write operations.</p>
</div>
<div class="style2">
  <h2>7. What challenges arise with Event Sourcing?</h2>
  <p>- Increased complexity in managing events.<br>
    - Eventual consistency issues.<br>

</div>
<div class="style2">
  <h2>8. How does the Outbox Pattern solve data consistency issues in Event Sourcing?</h2>

</div>
<div class="style2">
  <h2>9. What is a compensating transaction in Saga?</h2>
  <p>A compensating transaction reverses the effects of a previous transaction if a failure occurs, ensuring data consistency across microservices.</p>
</div>
<div class="style2">
  <h2>10. How does Kafka help in implementing CQRS?</h2>
  <p>Kafka enables event-driven CQRS by storing events in topics, allowing different services to consume and process them separately for read and write models.</p>

</div>
<div class="style2">
  <h2>15. How does the Choreography-based Saga pattern work?</h2>
  <p>In a Choreography-based Saga, microservices listen for events and react to them independently, eliminating the need for a central orchestrator.</p>
</div>
<div class="style2">
  <h2>16. What are the disadvantages of Choreography-based Saga?</h2>
  <p>- Difficult to track and debug due to distributed nature.<br>
    - Increases event complexity as the number of services grows.<br>
    - Harder to maintain consistency across services.</p>
</div>
<div class="style2">
  <h2>17. How does the Orchestration-based Saga pattern work?</h2>
