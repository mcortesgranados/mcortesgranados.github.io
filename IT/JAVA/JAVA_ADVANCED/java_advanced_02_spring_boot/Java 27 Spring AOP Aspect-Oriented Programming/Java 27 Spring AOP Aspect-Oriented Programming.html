    <h1>Spring AOP Interview Questions - Set 1</h1>

    <h2>1. What is Spring AOP?</h2>
    <p>Spring AOP (Aspect-Oriented Programming) is a programming paradigm that enables modularization of cross-cutting concerns like logging, security, and transaction management.</p>

    <h2>2. What are the key concepts of Spring AOP?</h2>
    <p>The main concepts in Spring AOP are Aspect, Advice, Join Point, Pointcut, Weaving, and Target Object.</p>

    <h2>3. What is an Aspect in Spring AOP?</h2>
    <p>An Aspect is a module that encapsulates cross-cutting concerns such as logging or security.</p>

    <h2>4. What is Advice in Spring AOP?</h2>
    <p>Advice defines what action an aspect should take and when it should be executed.</p>

    <h2>5. What are the types of Advice in Spring AOP?</h2>
    <p>Spring AOP provides five types of advice: Before, After, After Returning, After Throwing, and Around.</p>

    <h2>6. What is a Join Point in Spring AOP?</h2>
    <p>A Join Point is a specific point during execution where an aspect can be applied, such as method execution.</p>

    <h2>7. What is a Pointcut in Spring AOP?</h2>
    <p>A Pointcut is an expression that matches Join Points to determine where Advice should be applied.</p>

    <h2>8. What is Weaving in Spring AOP?</h2>
    <p>Weaving is the process of linking aspects with other application types or objects to create an advised object.</p>

    <h2>9. Can Spring AOP be used for method-level security?</h2>
    <p>Yes, Spring AOP can be used to enforce security rules at the method level using aspects.</p>

    <h2>10. Provide a simple example of a Before Advice in Spring AOP.</h2>
    <pre>
        <code>
            @Aspect
            @Component
            public class LoggingAspect {
                @Before("execution(* com.example.service.*.*(..))")
                public void logBeforeMethodExecution() {
                    System.out.println("Method execution started...");
                }
            }
        </code>

    <h2>113. What is Aspect Instantiation in Spring AOP?</h2>
    <p>Aspect instantiation refers to how aspects are created, either as singletons or per target object.</p>
    <h2>114. How can we limit aspect execution to specific beans?</h2>
    <p>By using the bean() pointcut designator to apply aspects only to certain Spring beans.</p>
    <h2>115. Can we apply AOP on static methods in Spring?</h2>
    <p>No, Spring AOP does not support static method interception since proxies work at the instance level.</p>
    <h2>116. What are the disadvantages of Spring AOP?</h2>
    <p>Spring AOP has limitations like no support for field-level interception and only method-level proxying.</p>
    <h2>117. How does Spring AOP handle exceptions?</h2>
    <p>By using @AfterThrowing advice, which executes when a method throws an exception.</p>
    <h2>118. How can we retrieve the return value of a method in AOP?</h2>
    <p>Using the @AfterReturning advice and accessing the returning parameter.</p>
    <h2>119. What is the purpose of @EnableAspectJAutoProxy?</h2>
    <p>It enables support for AspectJ-style aspects in a Spring application.</p>
