            <p class="answer">An event-driven architecture is a software design paradigm where components communicate with each other through events. Events are typically notifications that something has happened and trigger certain actions or workflows in response.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
            <p><strong>2. How does event-driven architecture improve scalability?</strong></p>
            <p class="answer">Event-driven architecture allows for asynchronous communication, where services don't need to wait for responses from other services, enabling better scalability. Events can be processed independently, and new services can easily be added to handle more events.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
            <p><strong>3. What are the components of an event-driven architecture?</strong></p>
            <p class="answer">The main components include event producers (emit events), event channels (convey events), and event consumers (react to events). These components interact asynchronously to process events and trigger further actions.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
            <p><strong>4. How do event-driven architectures handle failures?</strong></p>
            <p class="answer">In event-driven architectures, failure handling is managed by event brokers or queues. Events can be retried or redirected based on error conditions, and dead-letter queues can capture events that fail repeatedly.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
            <p><strong>5. What is the role of an event bus in an event-driven architecture?</strong></p>
