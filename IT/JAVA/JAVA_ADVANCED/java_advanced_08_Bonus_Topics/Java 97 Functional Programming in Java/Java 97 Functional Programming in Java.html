        <h3>Set 1</h3>

        <div class="question">
            <p><strong>1. What is functional programming in Java?</strong></p>
            <p class="answer">Functional programming in Java is a programming paradigm that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing state or mutable data. Java supports functional programming through features like lambda expressions, streams, and functional interfaces.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
            <p><strong>2. What are lambda expressions in Java?</strong></p>
            <p class="answer">Lambda expressions are a feature in Java introduced in Java 8, allowing you to express instances of functional interfaces (interfaces with a single abstract method) in a more concise and readable way. The syntax of a lambda expression is `(parameters) -> expression`.</p>
            <pre><code>
List<String> names = Arrays.asList("John", "Jane", "Doe");
names.forEach(name -> System.out.println(name));
            </code></pre>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
            <p><strong>3. What is a functional interface in Java?</strong></p>
            <p class="answer">A functional interface is an interface that contains exactly one abstract method, and it can have multiple default or static methods. These interfaces are used as the target types for lambda expressions and method references in Java.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
            <p><strong>4. How do you use the Stream API in Java?</strong></p>
            <p class="answer">The Stream API in Java allows you to process sequences of elements (like collections) in a functional style. You can use methods like `map()`, `filter()`, `reduce()`, `collect()`, etc., to process elements in a pipeline fashion.</p>
            <pre><code>
List<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
int sum = numbers.stream()
                .filter(n -> n % 2 == 0)
                .mapToInt(Integer::intValue)
                .sum();
System.out.println(sum);  // Output: 6
            </code></pre>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
            <p><strong>5. What is the difference between `map()` and `flatMap()` in Java Streams?</strong></p>
            <p class="answer">The `map()` function transforms each element of the stream into another element, while `flatMap()` is used to flatten nested structures like lists within lists, transforming each element of the stream into a stream and then flattening them into a single stream.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
            <p><strong>6. What is the purpose of the `Optional` class in Java?</strong></p>
            <p class="answer">The `Optional` class is used to represent a value that may or may not be present. It is often used to avoid null pointer exceptions and provide a way to handle missing values more functionally, using methods like `ifPresent()`, `map()`, and `orElse()`.</p>
            <pre><code>
Optional<String> name = Optional.of("John");
name.ifPresent(n -> System.out.println("Hello, " + n));
            </code></pre>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
            <p><strong>7. How do you use method references in Java?</strong></p>
            <p class="answer">Method references in Java provide a shorthand way of writing lambda expressions that call a specific method. The syntax for method references is `ClassName::methodName`, and it can be used in place of lambda expressions where a method is directly invoked.</p>
            <pre><code>
List<String> names = Arrays.asList("John", "Jane", "Doe");
names.forEach(System.out::println);  // Equivalent to: name -> System.out.println(name)
            </code></pre>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
            <p><strong>8. What is the `reduce()` function in Java Streams?</strong></p>
            <p class="answer">The `reduce()` function in Java Streams is used to combine elements of the stream into a single result, typically by performing some kind of aggregation or accumulation operation, such as sum, multiplication, etc.</p>
            <pre><code>
List<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
int sum = numbers.stream().reduce(0, Integer::sum);
System.out.println(sum);  // Output: 15
            </code></pre>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
            <p><strong>9. How do you filter elements in a stream in Java?</strong></p>
            <p class="answer">You can filter elements in a stream using the `filter()` method, which takes a predicate as an argument. It returns a new stream that only contains the elements that match the predicate.</p>
            <pre><code>
List<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
List<Integer> evenNumbers = numbers.stream()
                                  .filter(n -> n % 2 == 0)
                                  .collect(Collectors.toList());
System.out.println(evenNumbers);  // Output: [2, 4]
            </code></pre>
        </div>

      <div class="question">
            <p><strong>10. What are the key benefits of functional programming in Java?</strong></p>
          <p class="answer">The key benefits of functional programming in Java include improved readability, less boilerplate code, easier parallelism, more declarative code, and better handling of side effects. It also promotes immutability and safer handling of state.</p>
          <p class="answer">&nbsp;</p>
          <h3>Set 2</h3>
          <div class="question">
            <p><strong>11. What is a higher-order function in Java?</strong></p>
            <p class="answer">A higher-order function is a function that takes one or more functions as parameters, returns a function as a result, or both. Java’s functional interfaces, lambda expressions, and method references allow for higher-order functions.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="question">
            <p><strong>12. How does immutability work in functional programming in Java?</strong></p>
            <p class="answer">In functional programming, immutability refers to the idea that objects cannot be modified after they are created. In Java, this can be achieved by using final variables, making fields of objects final, and returning new objects rather than modifying existing ones.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="question">
            <p><strong>13. What is the difference between `collect()` and `toList()` in Java Streams?</strong></p>
            <p class="answer">`collect()` is a terminal operation that transforms the elements of the stream into a different form, such as a collection. `toList()` is a collector that collects the stream elements into a `List`. While `toList()` is a specific collector, `collect()` is more general and can be used with any collector.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="question">
            <p><strong>14. What does the `peek()` method do in Java Streams?</strong></p>
            <p class="answer">The `peek()` method in Java Streams is an intermediate operation that allows you to see the elements of the stream as they are processed. It is mainly used for debugging purposes or logging, as it does not modify the stream.</p>
            <pre><code>
List<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
numbers.stream()
       .peek(n -> System.out.println("Processing: " + n))
       .map(n -> n * 2)
       .collect(Collectors.toList());
            </code></pre>
          </div>
          <div class="question">
            <p><strong>15. What are default methods in Java interfaces?</strong></p>
            <p class="answer">Default methods are methods in interfaces that have a body. They allow interfaces to provide default implementations of methods, which helps maintain backward compatibility when new methods are added to interfaces.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="question">
            <p><strong>16. How does Java handle side effects in functional programming?</strong></p>
            <p class="answer">In functional programming, side effects are discouraged. Java handles side effects by encouraging immutability, stateless functions, and the use of pure functions, which don’t change any state outside of their scope or rely on external state.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="question">
            <p><strong>17. How can you create a stream from an array in Java?</strong></p>
            <p class="answer">You can create a stream from an array in Java using the `Arrays.stream()` method. This method returns a stream for the given array.</p>
            <pre><code>
int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
IntStream stream = Arrays.stream(numbers);
stream.forEach(System.out::println);
            </code></pre>
          </div>
          <div class="question">
            <p><strong>18. What is a `UnaryOperator` in Java?</strong></p>
            <p class="answer">A `UnaryOperator` is a functional interface in Java that represents a function that takes one argument of a specific type and returns a result of the same type. It is a specialization of the `Function` interface for cases where the input and output types are the same.</p>
            <pre><code>
UnaryOperator<Integer> doubleValue = x -> x * 2;
System.out.println(doubleValue.apply(5));  // Output: 10
            </code></pre>
          </div>
          <div class="question">
            <p><strong>19. What is a `BiFunction` in Java?</strong></p>
            <p class="answer">A `BiFunction` is a functional interface in Java that represents a function that takes two arguments of possibly different types and returns a result of another type. It is often used to combine or transform two input values into one output value.</p>
            <pre><code>
BiFunction add = (a, b) -> a + b;
System.out.println(add.apply(5, 10));  // Output: 15
            </code></pre>
          </div>
          <div class="question">
            <p><strong>20. How do you chain multiple operations in Java Streams?</strong></p>
            <p class="answer">In Java Streams, multiple operations can be chained together to form a pipeline. The intermediate operations (such as `map()`, `filter()`, etc.) are applied to the stream and the final result is produced by a terminal operation (like `collect()` or `forEach()`). Each operation returns a new stream.</p>
            <pre><code>
List<String> names = Arrays.asList("John", "Jane", "Alice", "Bob");
List<String> result = names.stream()
                           .filter(name -> name.length() > 3)
                           .map(String::toUpperCase)
                           .collect(Collectors.toList());
System.out.println(result);  // Output: [JOHN, JANE, ALICE]
            </code></pre>
          </div>
          <h3>Set 3</h3>
          <div class="question">
            <p><strong>21. What is a `Supplier` in Java?</strong></p>
            <p class="answer">A `Supplier` is a functional interface in Java that represents a function that takes no arguments and returns a result. It is often used when you need to supply a value but don't need to provide input data.</p>
            <pre><code>
Supplier<String> supplier = () -> "Hello, World!";
System.out.println(supplier.get());  // Output: Hello, World!
            </code></pre>
          </div>
          <div class="question">
            <p><strong>22. How can you use `Optional` to handle null values in Java?</strong></p>
            <p class="answer">`Optional` is a container object which may or may not contain a value. It is used to avoid `NullPointerException`. You can use methods like `isPresent()`, `ifPresent()`, or `orElse()` to handle values safely.</p>
            <pre><code>
Optional<String> name = Optional.ofNullable(null);
System.out.println(name.orElse("Default Value"));  // Output: Default Value
            </code></pre>
          </div>
          <div class="question">
            <p><strong>23. What is the `reduce()` method in Java Streams?</strong></p>
            <p class="answer">The `reduce()` method in Java Streams is a terminal operation that combines the elements of a stream into a single result. It takes an associative binary operator and can be used to accumulate values, such as summing or multiplying numbers.</p>
            <pre><code>
List<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
int sum = numbers.stream().reduce(0, (a, b) -> a + b);
System.out.println(sum);  // Output: 15
            </code></pre>
          </div>
          <div class="question">
            <p><strong>24. What is a `Stream` in Java?</strong></p>
            <p class="answer">A `Stream` in Java is a sequence of elements supporting sequential and parallel aggregate operations. Streams are not data structures, but they provide a functional approach to processing data in a declarative manner.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="question">
            <p><strong>25. How can you create an empty stream in Java?</strong></p>
            <p class="answer">You can create an empty stream in Java using the `Stream.empty()` method. This returns an empty stream with no elements.</p>
            <pre><code>
Stream<String> emptyStream = Stream.empty();
emptyStream.forEach(System.out::println);  // No output
            </code></pre>
          </div>
          <div class="question">
            <p><strong>26. What is a `Consumer` in Java?</strong></p>
            <p class="answer">A `Consumer` is a functional interface that represents a function that takes one argument and returns no result. It is commonly used to perform operations like printing, modifying, or logging data.</p>
            <pre><code>
Consumer<String> printer = message -> System.out.println(message);
printer.accept("Hello, World!");  // Output: Hello, World!
            </code></pre>
          </div>
          <div class="question">
            <p><strong>27. What does the `map()` method do in Java Streams?</strong></p>
            <p class="answer">The `map()` method is an intermediate operation that transforms the elements of the stream by applying a function to each element. It produces a new stream consisting of the transformed elements.</p>
            <pre><code>
List<String> names = Arrays.asList("john", "jane", "bob");
List<String> uppercasedNames = names.stream()
                                    .map(String::toUpperCase)
                                    .collect(Collectors.toList());
System.out.println(uppercasedNames);  // Output: [JOHN, JANE, BOB]
            </code></pre>
          </div>
          <div class="question">
            <p><strong>28. What is the difference between `filter()` and `map()` in Java Streams?</strong></p>
            <p class="answer">`filter()` is used to remove elements from the stream based on a condition, whereas `map()` transforms the elements of the stream using a provided function. `filter()` returns a new stream with elements that match the condition, while `map()` changes each element of the stream.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="question">
            <p><strong>29. How do you handle parallel streams in Java?</strong></p>
            <p class="answer">Parallel streams in Java are created by calling the `parallel()` method on a stream. This allows operations on the stream to be executed concurrently, which can improve performance on large datasets. However, you should use parallel streams with caution, as they may not always improve performance due to overhead or issues with thread safety.</p>
            <pre><code>
List<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
numbers.parallelStream().forEach(System.out::println);
            </code></pre>
          </div>
          <div class="question">
            <p><strong>30. What is the significance of `forEach()` in Java Streams?</strong></p>
            <p class="answer">The `forEach()` method is a terminal operation that performs an action for each element of the stream. It is typically used for operations like printing or logging the elements of the stream. It cannot be used after a terminal operation as it consumes the stream.</p>
            <pre><code>
List<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
numbers.stream().forEach(System.out::println);
            </code></pre>
          </div>

          <h3>Set 4</h3>
          <div class="question">
            <p><strong>31. What is the `flatMap()` method in Java Streams?</strong></p>
            <p class="answer">The `flatMap()` method is an intermediate operation that maps each element of the stream to another stream and flattens the resulting streams into a single stream. It is used when the transformation results in multiple elements per original element.</p>
            <pre><code>
List<List<String>> listOfLists = Arrays.asList(
    Arrays.asList("apple", "banana"),
    Arrays.asList("orange", "pear")
);
List<String> flattenedList = listOfLists.stream()
                                       .flatMap(List::stream)
                                       .collect(Collectors.toList());
System.out.println(flattenedList);  // Output: [apple, banana, orange, pear]
            </code></pre>
          </div>
          <div class="question">
            <p><strong>32. What is the difference between `collect()` and `toList()` in Java Streams?</strong></p>
            <p class="answer">`collect()` is a terminal operation that transforms a stream into a different form, typically a collection. `toList()` is a specific collector that collects the elements of the stream into a `List`. While `collect()` is a more general operation, `toList()` is a predefined collector for lists.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="question">
            <p><strong>33. How can you find the maximum value in a stream in Java?</strong></p>
            <p class="answer">To find the maximum value in a stream, you can use the `max()` method with a comparator. This returns an `Optional` that contains the maximum value, or is empty if the stream is empty.</p>
            <pre><code>
List<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
Optional<Integer> max = numbers.stream().max(Integer::compareTo);
max.ifPresent(System.out::println);  // Output: 5

          <div class="question">
            <p><strong>34. What is method reference in Java and how is it used with streams?</strong></p>
            <p class="answer">A method reference in Java is a shorthand for lambda expressions that call a method. It is used to refer to a method of an object or class without executing it. In streams, method references can replace lambda expressions for invoking methods directly on elements of the stream.</p>
            <pre><code>
List<String> names = Arrays.asList("john", "jane", "bob");
names.stream().map(String::toUpperCase).forEach(System.out::println);  // Output: JOHN, JANE, BOB
            </code></pre>
          </div>
          <div class="question">
            <p><strong>35. What does the `allMatch()` method do in Java Streams?</strong></p>
            <p class="answer">The `allMatch()` method is a short-circuiting terminal operation that checks if all elements in the stream satisfy a given predicate. It returns `true` if all elements match the predicate, or `false` otherwise.</p>
            <pre><code>
List<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(2, 4, 6, 8);
boolean allEven = numbers.stream().allMatch(n -> n % 2 == 0);
System.out.println(allEven);  // Output: true
            </code></pre>

          <div class="question">
            <p><strong>36. How do you handle exceptions in lambda expressions in Java?</strong></p>
            <p class="answer">Lambda expressions in Java do not allow checked exceptions directly. However, you can handle exceptions within a lambda by either catching them or using a custom wrapper method that handles the exception.</p>
            <pre><code>
Runnable task = () -> {
    try {
        // Code that might throw an exception
    } catch (Exception e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
    }
};
task.run();

          <div class="question">
            <p><strong>37. What is the `forEachOrdered()` method in Java Streams?</strong></p>
            <p class="answer">The `forEachOrdered()` method is similar to `forEach()`, but it guarantees that the elements will be processed in the encounter order, even if the stream is processed in parallel. This is useful when the order of processing is important.</p>
            <pre><code>
List<String> names = Arrays.asList("john", "jane", "bob");
names.parallelStream().forEachOrdered(System.out::println);
            </code></pre>
          </div>
          <div class="question">
            <p><strong>38. How can you convert a stream into an array in Java?</strong></p>
            <p class="answer">To convert a stream into an array, you can use the `toArray()` method. This method returns an array containing the elements of the stream.</p>
            <pre><code>
List<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
Integer[] array = numbers.stream().toArray(Integer[]::new);
System.out.println(Arrays.toString(array));  // Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

            <p><strong>112. How do you use `Stream.reduce()` in Java?</strong></p>
            <p class="answer">`Stream.reduce()` is a terminal operation that performs a reduction on the elements of the stream using an associative accumulation function and returns an `Optional` result.</p>
            <pre><code>
List<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4);
int sum = numbers.stream().reduce(0, Integer::sum);
System.out.println(sum);  // Output: 10

            <p><strong>113. What is `Stream.flatMap()` used for in Java?</strong></p>
            <p class="answer">`Stream.flatMap()` is an intermediate operation that replaces each element of the stream with a stream of new values, then flattens the resulting streams into a single stream.</p>
            <pre><code>
List<List<Integer>> listOfLists = Arrays.asList(
    Arrays.asList(1, 2), 
    Arrays.asList(3, 4)
);
List<Integer> flatList = listOfLists.stream()
                                   .flatMap(List::stream)
                                   .collect(Collectors.toList());
System.out.println(flatList);  // Output: [1, 2, 3, 4]

            <p><strong>114. What is the difference between `map()` and `flatMap()` in Java Streams?</strong></p>
            <p class="answer">`map()` transforms each element into one element, while `flatMap()` can transform each element into zero, one, or more elements and flattens the result into a single stream.</p>
            <pre><code>
Stream<String> words = Stream.of("hello", "world");
Stream<String> uppercased = words.map(String::toUpperCase);  // [HELLO, WORLD]
Stream<String> flatMapExample = Stream.of(Arrays.asList("a", "b"), Arrays.asList("c", "d"))
                                      .flatMap(List::stream);  // [a, b, c, d]

            <p><strong>115. How does `Stream.distinct()` work in Java?</strong></p>
            <p class="answer">`Stream.distinct()` is an intermediate operation that returns a stream with distinct elements (removes duplicates) according to the `equals()` method.</p>
            <pre><code>
List<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4);
numbers.stream().distinct().forEach(System.out::println);  // Output: 1, 2, 3, 4

            <p><strong>116. What is `Stream.anyMatch()` in Java?</strong></p>
            <p class="answer">`Stream.anyMatch()` is a terminal operation that checks whether any element in the stream matches the provided predicate. It returns `true` if at least one element satisfies the condition.</p>
            <pre><code>
List<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4);
boolean hasEven = numbers.stream().anyMatch(n -> n % 2 == 0);
System.out.println(hasEven);  // Output: true

            <p><strong>117. How does `Stream.noneMatch()` work in Java?</strong></p>
            <p class="answer">`Stream.noneMatch()` is a terminal operation that checks if no elements in the stream match the given predicate. It returns `true` if none of the elements satisfy the condition.</p>
            <pre><code>
List<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(1, 3, 5);
boolean noEven = numbers.stream().noneMatch(n -> n % 2 == 0);

            <p><strong>118. What is the purpose of `Stream.sorted()` in Java?</strong></p>
            <p class="answer">`Stream.sorted()` is an intermediate operation that returns a stream with elements sorted according to the natural order or using a custom comparator.</p>
            <pre><code>
List<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(5, 3, 2, 4, 1);
numbers.stream().sorted().forEach(System.out::println);  // Output: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5

            <p><strong>119. What is the `Function` functional interface in Java?</strong></p>
            <p class="answer">`Function` is a functional interface that represents a function that accepts one argument and produces a result. It has the method `apply()`.</p>
            <pre><code>
Function lengthFunction = String::length;
System.out.println(lengthFunction.apply("Hello"));  // Output: 5

            <p><strong>120. How do you use `Stream.toList()` in Java?</strong></p>
            <p class="answer">`Stream.toList()` is a terminal operation that collects the elements of a stream into a new list. This method was introduced in Java 16.</p>
            <pre><code>
List<Integer> numbers = Stream.of(1, 2, 3, 4).toList();
System.out.println(numbers);  // Output: [1, 2, 3, 4]
