1. What is functional programming in Java?

Functional programming in Java is a programming paradigm that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing state or mutable data. Java supports functional programming through features like lambda expressions, streams, and functional interfaces.

2. What are lambda expressions in Java?

Lambda expressions are a feature in Java introduced in Java 8, allowing you to express instances of functional interfaces (interfaces with a single abstract method) in a more concise and readable way. The syntax of a lambda expression is `(parameters) -> expression`.

3. What is a functional interface in Java?

A functional interface is an interface that contains exactly one abstract method, and it can have multiple default or static methods. These interfaces are used as the target types for lambda expressions and method references in Java.

4. How do you use the Stream API in Java?

The Stream API in Java allows you to process sequences of elements (like collections) in a functional style. You can use methods like `map()`, `filter()`, `reduce()`, `collect()`, etc., to process elements in a pipeline fashion.
            
5. What is the difference between `map()` and `flatMap()` in Java Streams?

The `map()` function transforms each element of the stream into another element, while `flatMap()` is used to flatten nested structures like lists within lists, transforming each element of the stream into a stream and then flattening them into a single stream.

6. What is the purpose of the `Optional` class in Java?

The `Optional` class is used to represent a value that may or may not be present. It is often used to avoid null pointer exceptions and provide a way to handle missing values more functionally, using methods like `ifPresent()`, `map()`, and `orElse()`.

7. How do you use method references in Java?

Method references in Java provide a shorthand way of writing lambda expressions that call a specific method. The syntax for method references is `ClassName::methodName`, and it can be used in place of lambda expressions where a method is directly invoked.

8. What is the `reduce()` function in Java Streams?

The `reduce()` function in Java Streams is used to combine elements of the stream into a single result, typically by performing some kind of aggregation or accumulation operation, such as sum, multiplication, etc.

9. How do you filter elements in a stream in Java?

You can filter elements in a stream using the `filter()` method, which takes a predicate as an argument. It returns a new stream that only contains the elements that match the predicate.
            
10. What are the key benefits of functional programming in Java?

The key benefits of functional programming in Java include improved readability, less boilerplate code, easier parallelism, more declarative code, and better handling of side effects. It also promotes immutability and safer handling of state.

`collect()` is a terminal operation that transforms the elements of the stream into a different form, such as a collection. `toList()` is a collector that collects the stream elements into a `List`.

The `peek()` method in Java Streams is an intermediate operation that allows you to see the elements of the stream as they are processed. It is mainly used for debugging purposes or logging, as it does not modify the stream.

15. What are default methods in Java interfaces?

Default methods are methods in interfaces that have a body. They allow interfaces to provide default implementations of methods, which helps maintain backward compatibility when new methods are added to interfaces.

16. How does Java handle side effects in functional programming?

In functional programming, side effects are discouraged. Java handles side effects by encouraging immutability, stateless functions, and the use of pure functions, which don’t change any state outside of their scope or rely on external state.
