<h1>Set 1 - Locking Mechanisms: ReentrantLock and ReadWriteLock</h1>
<div class="question"> <b>Q1: What is a ReentrantLock in Java?</b>
    <div class="answer">
      <p>A ReentrantLock is a synchronization mechanism in Java that allows a thread to acquire the lock multiple times. It also allows for more advanced lock management like timed lock acquisition, fairness policies, and interruptible locks.</p>
      <pre>
    ReentrantLock lock = new ReentrantLock();
    lock.lock();
    try {
        // critical section
    } finally {
        lock.unlock();
    }
            </pre>
    </div>
</div>
<div class="question"> <b>Q2: How does a ReadWriteLock differ from a ReentrantLock?</b>
    <div class="answer">
      <p>A ReadWriteLock allows multiple readers to access the resource simultaneously as long as no writer is accessing it. However, if a writer has locked the resource, no readers or other writers can access it. In contrast, a ReentrantLock only allows one thread to access the resource at a time.</p>
      <pre>
    ReadWriteLock rwLock = new ReentrantReadWriteLock();
    Lock readLock = rwLock.readLock();
    Lock writeLock = rwLock.writeLock();
    readLock.lock();
    try {
        // reading
    } finally {
        readLock.unlock();
    }
            </pre>
    </div>
</div>
<div class="question"> <b>Q3: When would you use a ReentrantLock?</b>
    <div class="answer">
      <p>A ReentrantLock is useful when you need more control over the locking mechanism, such as when you want to try to acquire a lock without blocking the thread or when you need a fair lock that guarantees thread access in order of acquisition.</p>
    </div>
</div>
<div class="question"> <b>Q4: What is the benefit of using ReadWriteLock?</b>
    <div class="answer">
      <p>The main benefit of using a ReadWriteLock is that it allows greater concurrency when the resource is being read by multiple threads, as it allows multiple threads to access the resource for reading while still ensuring mutual exclusion for writes.</p>
    </div>
</div>
<div class="question"> <b>Q5: What happens if a thread tries to acquire the write lock on a ReadWriteLock while other threads hold the read lock?</b>
    <div class="answer">
      <p>The write lock will be blocked until all read locks are released. This ensures that the write operation is performed when no other thread is reading the resource.</p>
    </div>
</div>
<div class="question"> <b>Q6: Can a thread holding a ReentrantLock also acquire the same lock again?</b>
    <div class="answer">
      <p>Yes, a thread that holds a ReentrantLock can re-acquire the same lock without causing a deadlock. This is because a ReentrantLock is reentrant, meaning the same thread can lock it multiple times, but it must unlock it the same number of times.</p>
    </div>
</div>
<div class="question"> <b>Q7: What is the difference between a fair and unfair ReentrantLock?</b>
    <div class="answer">
      <p>A fair ReentrantLock guarantees that the longest waiting thread will acquire the lock next, avoiding starvation. An unfair ReentrantLock does not guarantee this order and may allow threads that acquire the lock later to bypass earlier waiting threads.</p>
      <pre>
    ReentrantLock fairLock = new ReentrantLock(true); // Fair lock
    ReentrantLock unfairLock = new ReentrantLock();  // Unfair lock
            </pre>
    </div>
</div>
<div class="question"> <b>Q8: How would you implement a timed lock using ReentrantLock?</b>
    <div class="answer">
      <p>You can use the <code>tryLock</code> method of ReentrantLock to attempt to acquire the lock within a specific time frame. If the lock is not available within the time limit, it will return <code>false</code>.</p>
      <pre>
    boolean locked = lock.tryLock(10, TimeUnit.SECONDS);
    if (locked) {
        try {
            // critical section
        } finally {
            lock.unlock();
        }
    } else {
        System.out.println(&quot;Unable to acquire lock within the time limit.&quot;);
    }
            </pre>
    </div>
</div>
<div class="question"> <b>Q9: What does the method <code>lockInterruptibly</code> in ReentrantLock do?</b>
    <div class="answer">
      <p>The <code>lockInterruptibly</code> method allows a thread to attempt to acquire the lock, but if the thread is interrupted while waiting for the lock, it will throw an InterruptedException instead of blocking indefinitely.</p>
      <pre>
    try {
        lock.lockInterruptibly();
        // critical section
    } catch (InterruptedException e) {
        System.out.println(&quot;Thread was interrupted while waiting for the lock.&quot;);
    } finally {
        lock.unlock();
    }
            </pre>
    </div>
</div>
<div class="question"> <b>Q10: Can you upgrade a ReadWriteLock from a read lock to a write lock?</b>
    <div class="answer">
      <p>No, you cannot directly upgrade a read lock to a write lock in a ReadWriteLock. If you hold a read lock and want to write, you must release the read lock and then acquire the write lock.</p>
    </div>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Set 2 - Locking Mechanisms: ReentrantLock and ReadWriteLock</h1>
<div class="question"> <b>Q11: What happens if you forget to release a lock in ReentrantLock?</b>
    <div class="answer">
      <p>If you forget to release a lock in ReentrantLock, it will cause a deadlock or indefinite blocking, as the lock will remain held, preventing other threads from entering the critical section.</p>
    </div>
</div>
<div class="question"> <b>Q12: How does a ReentrantLock compare to the synchronized keyword?</b>
    <div class="answer">
      <p>A ReentrantLock provides more flexible lock management compared to the synchronized keyword. It allows timed lock acquisition, interruptible lock acquisition, and fairness policies, whereas the synchronized keyword provides a simpler mechanism but lacks these advanced features.</p>
    </div>
</div>
<div class="question"> <b>Q13: Can you use multiple ReadWriteLocks in a single application?</b>
    <div class="answer">
      <p>Yes, you can use multiple ReadWriteLocks in a single application. Each ReadWriteLock instance can manage its own set of read and write locks independently of others.</p>
    </div>
</div>
<div class="question"> <b>Q14: How does a ReentrantReadWriteLock work?</b>
    <div class="answer">
      <p>A ReentrantReadWriteLock allows multiple readers to acquire the read lock simultaneously, but only one thread can acquire the write lock. The write lock is exclusive, meaning no readers or other writers can access the resource when the write lock is held.</p>
      <pre>
    ReadWriteLock lock = new ReentrantReadWriteLock();
    Lock readLock = lock.readLock();
    Lock writeLock = lock.writeLock();

    // Reading
    readLock.lock();
    try {
        // read operations
    } finally {
        readLock.unlock();
    }

    // Writing
    writeLock.lock();
    try {
        // write operations
    } finally {
        writeLock.unlock();
    }
            </pre>
    </div>
</div>
<div class="question"> <b>Q15: What are the potential issues with using ReadWriteLocks?</b>
    <div class="answer">
      <p>One potential issue is that if a thread acquires a write lock, no other thread can acquire a read lock, which may lead to thread starvation. Also, improper use of ReadWriteLocks could result in unnecessary blocking or deadlock if not managed properly.</p>
    </div>
</div>
<div class="question"> <b>Q16: What is the advantage of using tryLock with ReentrantLock?</b>
    <div class="answer">
      <p>The advantage of using tryLock is that it allows the thread to attempt to acquire the lock without blocking indefinitely. It can either proceed if the lock is acquired successfully or handle the case where the lock is unavailable after a specified timeout.</p>
      <pre>
    boolean acquired = lock.tryLock(5, TimeUnit.SECONDS);
    if (acquired) {
        try {
            // critical section
        } finally {
            lock.unlock();
        }
    } else {
        System.out.println(&quot;Lock acquisition failed.&quot;);
    }
            </pre>
    </div>
</div>
<div class="question"> <b>Q17: How do you ensure fairness when using ReentrantLock?</b>
    <div class="answer">
      <p>To ensure fairness, you can create a ReentrantLock instance with the fairness parameter set to true. This guarantees that the longest-waiting thread will acquire the lock next.</p>
      <pre>
    ReentrantLock lock = new ReentrantLock(true); // fair lock
    lock.lock();
    try {
        // critical section
    } finally {
        lock.unlock();
    }
            </pre>
    </div>
</div>
<div class="question"> <b>Q18: How can you avoid deadlocks with ReentrantLock?</b>
    <div class="answer">
      <p>To avoid deadlocks, you can acquire locks in a consistent order across threads, use tryLock with timeouts to avoid indefinite blocking, and ensure that locks are always released in the same order.</p>
    </div>
</div>
<div class="question"> <b>Q19: What is the purpose of the <code>newCondition</code> method in ReentrantLock?</b>
    <div class="answer">
      <p>The <code>newCondition</code> method creates a new Condition instance that allows threads to wait for a specific condition before proceeding. This can be used for inter-thread communication within a critical section.</p>
      <pre>
    Condition condition = lock.newCondition();
    lock.lock();
    try {
        while (!conditionMet) {
            condition.await();
        }
        // proceed with work
    } finally {
        lock.unlock();
    }
            </pre>
    </div>
</div>
<div class="question"> <b>Q20: Can a thread acquire both the read and write lock in ReadWriteLock?</b>
    <div class="answer">
      <p>No, a thread cannot acquire both the read and write locks in a ReadWriteLock at the same time. If a thread holds a read lock, it cannot acquire the write lock, and vice versa, to ensure proper synchronization.</p>
    </div>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Set 3 - Locking Mechanisms: ReentrantLock and ReadWriteLock</h1>
<div class="question"> <b>Q21: What is the difference between <code>lock()</code> and <code>tryLock()</code> in ReentrantLock?</b>
    <div class="answer">
      <p>The <code>lock()</code> method blocks the thread indefinitely until the lock is available, while <code>tryLock()</code> attempts to acquire the lock without blocking and returns <code>false</code> if the lock is unavailable.</p>
    </div>
</div>
<div class="question"> <b>Q22: How do you implement a timed lock acquisition using ReentrantLock?</b>
    <div class="answer">
      <p>To implement a timed lock acquisition, you can use the <code>tryLock(long time, TimeUnit unit)</code> method, which tries to acquire the lock within the specified timeout. If the lock isn't acquired within the timeout, it returns <code>false</code>.</p>
      <pre>
    boolean acquired = lock.tryLock(5, TimeUnit.SECONDS);
    if (acquired) {
        try {
            // critical section
        } finally {
            lock.unlock();
        }
    } else {
        System.out.println(&quot;Lock acquisition failed within timeout.&quot;);
    }
            </pre>
    </div>
</div>
<div class="question"> <b>Q23: What is the impact of fairness in ReentrantLock?</b>
    <div class="answer">
      <p>When fairness is enabled in a ReentrantLock, it ensures that the lock is granted in the order threads request it, which can help prevent thread starvation. However, enabling fairness can decrease overall throughput because it introduces additional overhead.</p>
    </div>
</div>
<div class="question"> <b>Q24: Can a thread hold a ReentrantLock multiple times?</b>
    <div class="answer">
      <p>Yes, a thread can acquire the same ReentrantLock multiple times, which is why it is called &quot;reentrant.&quot; The thread must release the lock the same number of times it acquired it before other threads can acquire the lock.</p>
      <pre>
    lock.lock(); // first acquisition
    lock.lock(); // second acquisition
    try {
        // critical section
    } finally {
        lock.unlock(); // first release
        lock.unlock(); // second release
    }
            </pre>
    </div>
</div>
<div class="question"> <b>Q25: How do you handle a deadlock when using multiple locks?</b>
    <div class="answer">
      <p>To avoid deadlocks when using multiple locks, you should always acquire the locks in a consistent, predefined order. Alternatively, you can use <code>tryLock()</code> with a timeout to avoid waiting indefinitely and handle situations where a deadlock may occur.</p>
    </div>
</div>
<div class="question"> <b>Q26: Can a ReadWriteLock allow multiple threads to write simultaneously?</b>
    <div class="answer">
      <p>No, a ReadWriteLock ensures that only one thread can acquire the write lock at any given time. If a thread holds the write lock, no other threads (either readers or writers) can access the resource until the write lock is released.</p>
    </div>
</div>
<div class="question"> <b>Q27: When should you prefer using ReentrantLock over synchronized?</b>
    <div class="answer">
      <p>You should prefer using ReentrantLock over synchronized when you need more flexibility, such as the ability to interrupt a thread while waiting for the lock, or when you need timed lock acquisition or the ability to acquire multiple locks at once.</p>
    </div>
</div>
<div class="question"> <b>Q28: How does the <code>lockInterruptibly()</code> method work in ReentrantLock?</b>
    <div class="answer">
      <p>The <code>lockInterruptibly()</code> method allows a thread to acquire a lock, but it can be interrupted while waiting for the lock. If the thread is interrupted while waiting, it throws an <code>InterruptedException</code>.</p>
      <pre>
    try {
        lock.lockInterruptibly();
        try {
            // critical section
        } finally {
            lock.unlock();
        }
    } catch (InterruptedException e) {
        System.out.println(&quot;Thread was interrupted while waiting for the lock.&quot;);
    }
            </pre>
    </div>
</div>
<div class="question"> <b>Q29: How do you implement a fair ReadWriteLock?</b>
    <div class="answer">
      <p>To implement a fair ReadWriteLock, you can use <code>ReentrantReadWriteLock(true)</code>, which ensures that the lock is granted to the threads in the order they requested it, preventing starvation.</p>
      <pre>
    ReadWriteLock lock = new ReentrantReadWriteLock(true); // fair lock
    Lock readLock = lock.readLock();
    Lock writeLock = lock.writeLock();
    </pre>
    </div>
</div>
<div class="question"> <b>Q30: What happens when a thread holding the write lock in ReadWriteLock is interrupted?</b>
    <div class="answer">
      <p>If a thread holding the write lock is interrupted, the thread will not automatically release the lock. However, it will throw an <code>InterruptedException</code> if it attempts to do any further work or wait for other conditions.</p>
    </div>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Set 4 - Locking Mechanisms: ReentrantLock and ReadWriteLock</h1>
<div class="question"> <b>Q31: Can a ReadWriteLock be used to implement a thread-safe cache?</b>
    <div class="answer">
      <p>Yes, a ReadWriteLock can be used to implement a thread-safe cache where multiple threads can read data concurrently, but only one thread can update the cache at a time. The read lock can be used for reading, while the write lock ensures exclusive access when writing or updating data.</p>
    </div>
</div>
<div class="question"> <b>Q32: How does the <code>ReentrantLock</code> improve performance over synchronized blocks?</b>
    <div class="answer">
      <p>ReentrantLock provides more flexibility compared to synchronized blocks, such as the ability to try to acquire a lock, the option to acquire the lock with a timeout, or interrupt a thread while waiting for the lock. These features can improve performance in concurrent applications, especially when dealing with contention.</p>
    </div>
</div>
<div class="question"> <b>Q33: What happens if a thread tries to acquire a lock that it already holds?</b>
    <div class="answer">
      <p>In the case of <code>ReentrantLock</code>, the thread can acquire the lock multiple times (reentrantly). The lock is held by the thread as long as the thread releases it the same number of times it acquired it. If a thread tries to acquire a lock it already holds, it will not block, but simply increase the hold count.</p>
    </div>
</div>
<div class="question"> <b>Q34: What is the advantage of using <code>ReadWriteLock</code> over a regular lock in scenarios where data is mostly read?</b>
    <div class="answer">
      <p>The advantage of using <code>ReadWriteLock</code> in read-heavy scenarios is that it allows multiple threads to acquire the read lock concurrently, thus improving throughput when reading data. However, it ensures exclusive access for write operations, preventing conflicts between reading and writing threads.</p>
    </div>
</div>
<div class="question"> <b>Q35: Can <code>ReentrantLock</code> be used in a recursive method?</b>
    <div class="answer">
      <p>Yes, <code>ReentrantLock</code> can be used in recursive methods because it allows the same thread to acquire the lock multiple times without blocking. However, you must ensure that the lock is released the same number of times that it was acquired, or else you may encounter issues.</p>
    </div>
</div>
<div class="question"> <b>Q36: What is the difference between <code>ReentrantLock</code> and <code>ReentrantReadWriteLock</code>?</b>
    <div class="answer">
      <p><code>ReentrantLock</code> provides exclusive locking, meaning only one thread can hold the lock at a time. <code>ReentrantReadWriteLock</code>, on the other hand, provides two types of locks: a read lock (shared) and a write lock (exclusive), allowing multiple threads to read concurrently but only one to write at a time.</p>
    </div>
</div>
<div class="question"> <b>Q37: How does <code>ReentrantLock</code> handle thread interruptions?</b>
    <div class="answer">
      <p><code>ReentrantLock</code> provides the <code>lockInterruptibly()</code> method, which allows a thread to be interrupted while waiting to acquire the lock. If the thread is interrupted before acquiring the lock, it will throw an <code>InterruptedException</code>, which can be handled in a try-catch block.</p>
      <pre>
    try {
        lock.lockInterruptibly();
        // critical section
    } catch (InterruptedException e) {
        System.out.println(&quot;Thread interrupted while waiting for lock&quot;);
    } finally {
        lock.unlock();
    }
            </pre>
    </div>
</div>
<div class="question"> <b>Q38: How do you avoid race conditions with <code>ReadWriteLock</code>?</b>
    <div class="answer">
      <p>Race conditions can be avoided by ensuring that only one thread can hold the write lock at a time while multiple threads can hold the read lock concurrently. Proper synchronization and careful management of the read and write operations can prevent data inconsistency.</p>
    </div>
</div>
<div class="question"> <b>Q39: What is a potential downside of using <code>ReentrantLock</code> for thread synchronization?</b>
    <div class="answer">
      <p>A potential downside of using <code>ReentrantLock</code> is that it requires manual management of lock acquisition and release, which can lead to deadlocks or lock leaks if not properly handled. Additionally, <code>ReentrantLock</code> introduces overhead compared to synchronized blocks.</p>
    </div>
</div>
<div class="question"> <b>Q40: How do you upgrade the performance of a multi-threaded application using <code>ReadWriteLock</code>?</b>
    <div class="answer">
      <p>You can improve performance by using <code>ReadWriteLock</code> to allow concurrent read operations when data is not being modified, which is especially useful for read-heavy applications. Ensure that write operations are minimal and controlled to avoid blocking read threads for long periods.</p>
    </div>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Set 5 - Locking Mechanisms: ReentrantLock and ReadWriteLock</h1>
<div class="question"> <b>Q41: How does <code>ReentrantLock</code> handle multiple threads trying to acquire the lock?</b>
    <div class="answer">
      <p>If multiple threads try to acquire a <code>ReentrantLock</code> at the same time, only one thread will successfully acquire the lock. The others will be blocked until the lock is released. The order in which threads acquire the lock depends on the lock's implementation (e.g., first-come, first-served or fair locking).</p>
    </div>
</div>
<div class="question"> <b>Q42: Can a <code>ReadWriteLock</code> be implemented using multiple <code>ReentrantLocks</code>?</b>
    <div class="answer">
      <p>Yes, a <code>ReadWriteLock</code> can be manually implemented using multiple <code>ReentrantLocks</code>—one for reading and one for writing. However, the built-in <code>ReentrantReadWriteLock</code> provides a more efficient and robust solution, as it properly manages concurrency between readers and writers.</p>
    </div>
</div>
<div class="question"> <b>Q43: What is the <code>tryLock()</code> method in <code>ReentrantLock</code>?</b>
    <div class="answer">
      <p>The <code>tryLock()</code> method in <code>ReentrantLock</code> attempts to acquire the lock without blocking. If the lock is available, the method will acquire the lock and return true. If the lock is not available, the method will return false without blocking the thread. It can be useful for implementing non-blocking algorithms.</p>
      <pre>
    ReentrantLock lock = new ReentrantLock();
    if (lock.tryLock()) {
        // Lock acquired
    } else {
        // Lock not available
    }
            </pre>
    </div>
</div>
<div class="question"> <b>Q44: When should you use <code>ReadWriteLock</code> instead of a simple lock?</b>
    <div class="answer">
      <p>You should use <code>ReadWriteLock</code> when your application has more read operations than write operations. It allows multiple threads to read concurrently, improving performance for read-heavy workloads. However, if write operations are frequent or require exclusive access, a simple lock may be sufficient.</p>
    </div>
</div>
<div class="question"> <b>Q45: How can you avoid deadlocks when using <code>ReentrantLock</code>?</b>
    <div class="answer">
      <p>To avoid deadlocks, make sure that locks are always acquired in a consistent order, and always release locks in the reverse order. Additionally, you can use timeout methods like <code>tryLock()</code> to attempt to acquire a lock and avoid waiting indefinitely.</p>
    </div>
</div>
<div class="question"> <b>Q46: How can a <code>ReentrantLock</code> be used to implement a thread-safe counter?</b>
    <div class="answer">
      <p>A <code>ReentrantLock</code> can be used to synchronize access to the counter, ensuring that only one thread can update the counter at a time. Here is an example:</p>
      <pre>
    class Counter {
        private int count = 0;
        private final ReentrantLock lock = new ReentrantLock();

        public void increment() {
            lock.lock();
            try {
                count++;
            } finally {
                lock.unlock();
            }
        }

        public int getCount() {
            return count;
        }
    }
            </pre>
    </div>
</div>
<div class="question"> <b>Q47: What are some advantages of using <code>ReentrantLock</code> over synchronized blocks?</b>
    <div class="answer">
      <p>Advantages of <code>ReentrantLock</code> over synchronized blocks include: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Ability to try locking with <code>tryLock()</code> to avoid blocking.</li>
        <li>Ability to lock with a timeout using <code>tryLock(long timeout, TimeUnit unit)</code>.</li>
        <li>Ability to interrupt a thread waiting for the lock using <code>lockInterruptibly()</code>.</li>
        <li>Better support for fairness by using the <code>ReentrantLock(true)</code> constructor to ensure FIFO lock acquisition.</li>
      </ul>
      </p>
    </div>
</div>
<div class="question"> <b>Q48: Can you use <code>ReentrantLock</code> with multiple conditions?</b>
    <div class="answer">
      <p>Yes, <code>ReentrantLock</code> supports multiple <code>Condition</code> objects, allowing you to have different waiting conditions within the same lock. This can be useful for implementing more complex synchronization patterns, where different threads may need to wait on different conditions.</p>
      <pre>
    ReentrantLock lock = new ReentrantLock();
    Condition condition1 = lock.newCondition();
    Condition condition2 = lock.newCondition();

<div class="question"> <b>Q49: What are the performance implications of using <code>ReadWriteLock</code>?</b>
    <div class="answer">
      <p>Using <code>ReadWriteLock</code> can improve performance in read-heavy applications, as it allows concurrent reads. However, the performance benefit is reduced in write-heavy applications because write locks are exclusive, and they may block read operations. Additionally, the internal implementation of <code>ReadWriteLock</code> can incur some overhead due to coordination between reader and writer threads.</p>
    </div>
</div>
<div class="question"> <b>Q50: How do you handle starvation with <code>ReentrantLock</code>?</b>
    <div class="answer">
      <p>Starvation can occur when one thread repeatedly acquires the lock, preventing other threads from acquiring it. You can avoid starvation by using fair locks (i.e., using <code>ReentrantLock(true)</code>) to ensure that threads acquire the lock in the order they requested it, preventing any thread from being indefinitely blocked.</p>

<div class="question"> <b>Q51: What is the purpose of <code>lockInterruptibly()</code> method in <code>ReentrantLock</code>?</b>
    <div class="answer">
      <p>The <code>lockInterruptibly()</code> method allows a thread to acquire the lock unless it is interrupted. If the thread is interrupted while waiting for the lock, it will throw an <code>InterruptedException</code> and release the lock immediately, making it responsive to interrupts.</p>
    </div>
</div>
<div class="question"> <b>Q52: How do <code>ReentrantLock</code> and <code>synchronized</code> blocks compare in terms of performance?</b>
    <div class="answer">
      <p><code>ReentrantLock</code> tends to have better performance compared to <code>synchronized</code> blocks in cases where more control is needed, such as with try-lock, timed lock, or interruptible lock. However, <code>synchronized</code> blocks are simpler and easier to use, making them more efficient for basic synchronization needs.</p>
    </div>
</div>
<div class="question"> <b>Q53: Can <code>ReadWriteLock</code> allow for both reading and writing simultaneously?</b>
    <div class="answer">
      <p>No, a <code>ReadWriteLock</code> ensures mutual exclusion between writers. While multiple threads can acquire the read lock simultaneously, the write lock is exclusive and prevents both reads and writes from occurring concurrently.</p>
    </div>
</div>
<div class="question"> <b>Q54: What happens if you try to acquire a <code>ReadWriteLock</code> read lock while another thread holds the write lock?</b>
    <div class="answer">
      <p>If a thread holds the write lock, no other thread can acquire the read lock. The read lock will be blocked until the write lock is released, ensuring that no reads occur while the data is being modified.</p>
    </div>
</div>
<div class="question"> <b>Q55: Can you nest locks with <code>ReentrantLock</code>?</b>
    <div class="answer">
      <p>Yes, <code>ReentrantLock</code> allows nesting, meaning that a thread can lock the same lock multiple times without deadlocking itself. Each call to <code>lock()</code> must be followed by a corresponding <code>unlock()</code> call to release the lock.</p>
      <pre>
    ReentrantLock lock = new ReentrantLock();
    lock.lock();
    try {
        lock.lock(); // No deadlock here
        // Do some work
    } finally {

</div>
<div class="question"> <b>Q56: What is the difference between a fair and unfair <code>ReentrantLock</code>?</b>
    <div class="answer">
      <p>A fair <code>ReentrantLock</code> ensures that threads acquire the lock in the order in which they requested it (FIFO order). An unfair <code>ReentrantLock</code> does not guarantee this, and threads may acquire the lock in any order, potentially leading to starvation for some threads.</p>
      <pre>
    ReentrantLock fairLock = new ReentrantLock(true); // Fair lock
    ReentrantLock unfairLock = new ReentrantLock(false); // Unfair lock

</div>
<div class="question"> <b>Q57: What happens when a <code>ReadWriteLock</code> write lock is acquired?</b>
    <div class="answer">
      <p>When a thread acquires a <code>ReadWriteLock</code> write lock, it has exclusive access to the resource. No other thread can acquire either the read or write lock until the write lock is released. This ensures that data is not read or written simultaneously.</p>
    </div>
</div>
<div class="question"> <b>Q58: How can you implement a fair <code>ReentrantLock</code>?</b>
    <div class="answer">
      <p>To implement a fair <code>ReentrantLock</code>, pass <code>true</code> to the constructor, ensuring that the lock is acquired by threads in the order they requested it. This prevents thread starvation by ensuring FIFO (First In First Out) order.</p>

<div class="question"> <b>Q60: How can you implement a condition variable with <code>ReentrantLock</code>?</b>
    <div class="answer">
      <p>A condition variable allows a thread to wait until a particular condition is met. With <code>ReentrantLock</code>, you can create a <code>Condition</code> object and use its <code>await()</code> and <code>signal()</code> methods to implement the condition.</p>
      <pre>
    ReentrantLock lock = new ReentrantLock();
    Condition condition = lock.newCondition();

<div class="question"> <b>Q63: What is the significance of <code>ReentrantLock</code> being fair or unfair?</b>
    <div class="answer">
      <p>A fair lock ensures that threads acquire the lock in the order in which they requested it, preventing thread starvation. An unfair lock, however, does not guarantee this and can allow newer threads to acquire the lock before older ones.</p>
    </div>
</div>
<div class="question"> <b>Q64: How does a <code>ReadWriteLock</code> improve performance compared to a <code>ReentrantLock</code>?</b>
    <div class="answer">
      <p><code>ReadWriteLock</code> improves performance in scenarios where many threads need to read shared data concurrently. It allows multiple threads to read the data simultaneously, while ensuring exclusive access for writing, which improves throughput in read-heavy workloads.</p>
    </div>
</div>
<div class="question"> <b>Q65: Can a <code>ReadWriteLock</code> be upgraded from a read lock to a write lock?</b>
    <div class="answer">
      <p>No, you cannot directly upgrade a read lock to a write lock. If a thread holds a read lock and wants to acquire a write lock, it must first release the read lock and then acquire the write lock.</p>
    </div>
</div>
<div class="question"> <b>Q66: What happens if a thread tries to acquire the write lock on a <code>ReadWriteLock</code> while other threads hold the read lock?</b>
    <div class="answer">

    <div class="answer">
      <p>No, <code>ReadWriteLock</code> prevents write access while threads hold read locks. Write access is exclusive, meaning no threads can read or write when a thread holds a write lock.</p>
    </div>

<div class="question"> <b>Q97: How do you upgrade a <code>ReadWriteLock</code> from a read lock to a write lock?</b>
    <div class="answer">
      <p><code>ReadWriteLock</code> does not support direct upgrading from a read lock to a write lock. To upgrade, you must release the read lock and acquire the write lock. This can be done in a critical section to avoid losing the read lock before acquiring the write lock.</p>

<div class="question"> <b>Q98: What is the purpose of the <code>ReentrantLock</code> <code>unlock()</code> method?</b>
    <div class="answer">
      <p>The <code>unlock()</code> method releases the lock that was previously acquired by the current thread. This allows other threads to acquire the lock and access the critical section. It is crucial to call <code>unlock()</code> in a <code>finally</code> block to ensure the lock is always released.</p>
      <pre>
    ReentrantLock lock = new ReentrantLock();
    lock.lock();
    try {
        // Critical section
    } finally {
        lock.unlock();
    }
            </pre>
    </div>
</div>
<div class="question"> <b>Q99: What are some common mistakes when using <code>ReentrantLock</code>?</b>
    <div class="answer">
      <p>Some common mistakes include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Forgetting to release the lock in a <code>finally</code> block, leading to deadlocks.</li>
        <li>Not using <code>lockInterruptibly()</code> when needing to handle thread interruptions properly.</li>
        <li>Acquiring locks in inconsistent orders, leading to deadlocks.</li>
      </ul>

<div class="question"> <b>Q100: How can you use a <code>ReentrantLock</code> in combination with a <code>Condition</code> to implement a thread-safe queue?</b>
    <div class="answer">
      <p>You can use a <code>ReentrantLock</code> with a <code>Condition</code> to implement a thread-safe queue. The lock ensures exclusive access to the queue, while the condition allows threads to wait for the queue to be non-empty before consuming items, or for space to become available before adding items.</p>
      <pre>
    ReentrantLock lock = new ReentrantLock();
    Condition notEmpty = lock.newCondition();
    Queue<Integer> queue = new LinkedList&lt;&gt;();
    
    // Producer thread
    lock.lock();
    try {
        queue.offer(1);
        notEmpty.signal();
    } finally {
        lock.unlock();
    }

    // Consumer thread
    lock.lock();
    try {
        while (queue.isEmpty()) {
            notEmpty.await();
        }
        int item = queue.poll();
    } finally {
        lock.unlock();
    }
            </pre>
