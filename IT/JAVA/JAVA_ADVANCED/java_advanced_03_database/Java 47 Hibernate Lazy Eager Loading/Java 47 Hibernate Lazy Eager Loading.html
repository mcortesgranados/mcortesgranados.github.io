        <div class="question">
            1. What is Hibernate and how does it relate to Lazy and Eager Loading?      </div>
        <div class="answer">
            Hibernate is an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) framework that facilitates the conversion between Java objects and relational database tables. Lazy and Eager Loading are strategies used to control the fetching of related entities in Hibernate.      </div>

        <div class="question">
            2. What is Lazy Loading in Hibernate?      </div>
        <div class="answer">
            Lazy Loading in Hibernate means that related entities are fetched only when they are accessed for the first time. This improves performance by avoiding unnecessary database queries.      </div>

        <div class="question">
            3. What is Eager Loading in Hibernate?      </div>
        <div class="answer">
            Eager Loading in Hibernate means that related entities are fetched immediately when the parent entity is loaded. This may lead to multiple database queries but ensures that related data is available.      </div>

        <div class="question">
            4. How do you implement Lazy Loading in Hibernate?      </div>
        <div class="answer">
            Lazy Loading is implemented using the `@OneToMany(fetch = FetchType.LAZY)` annotation on the relationship, meaning the related entities are fetched only when explicitly accessed.      </div>
        <div class="style3">
            @Entity
            public class ParentEntity {
                @OneToMany(fetch = FetchType.LAZY)
                private Set<ChildEntity> children;
            }      </div>

        <div class="question">
            5. How do you implement Eager Loading in Hibernate?      </div>
        <div class="answer">
            Eager Loading is implemented using the `@OneToMany(fetch = FetchType.EAGER)` annotation, causing related entities to be loaded immediately when the parent entity is fetched.        </div>
        <div class="style4">
            @Entity
            public class ParentEntity {
                @OneToMany(fetch = FetchType.EAGER)
                private Set<ChildEntity> children;
            }        </div>

        <div class="question">
            6. What are the pros and cons of Lazy Loading?        </div>
        <div class="answer">
            Pros of Lazy Loading:
            <ul>
                <li>Improves performance by loading related entities only when required.</li>
                <li>Reduces initial database load.</li>
            </ul>
            Cons of Lazy Loading:
            <ul>
                <li>Can lead to the "N+1 select problem" if not managed correctly.</li>
                <li>May cause performance issues if entities are accessed multiple times.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
            7. What are the pros and cons of Eager Loading?        </div>
        <div class="answer">
            Pros of Eager Loading:
            <ul>
                <li>All related data is available immediately, avoiding additional queries.</li>
                <li>Can improve performance when related entities are always needed.</li>
            </ul>
            Cons of Eager Loading:
            <ul>
                <li>May lead to unnecessary data loading, increasing memory usage.</li>
                <li>Can slow down performance by executing multiple database queries.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
            8. What is the "N+1 select problem" in Hibernate?        </div>
        <div class="answer">
            The "N+1 select problem" occurs when Hibernate performs one query to load the parent entity and one query per related entity. This can result in many unnecessary database queries and performance issues.        </div>

        <div class="question">
            9. How can you prevent the "N+1 select problem" in Hibernate?        </div>
        <div class="answer">
            The "N+1 select problem" can be avoided by using Eager Loading (`FetchType.EAGER`), or more commonly by using `@ManyToOne(fetch = FetchType.LAZY)` and then using `JOIN FETCH` in the query.        </div>
        <div class="style5">
            @Query("SELECT p FROM ParentEntity p JOIN FETCH p.children")
            List<ParentEntity> findAllWithChildren();        </div>

        <div class="question">
            10. What is the `@Fetch` annotation in Hibernate, and how does it help with Lazy/Eager loading?        </div>
        <div class="answer">
            The `@Fetch` annotation allows you to define how associations are fetched, for example, `FetchMode.JOIN` can be used to fetch associations eagerly in a single query, while `FetchMode.SELECT` can be used to fetch them lazily.        </div>
        <div class="style6">
            @Entity
            public class ParentEntity {
                @OneToMany(fetch = FetchType.LAZY)
                @Fetch(FetchMode.JOIN)
                private Set<ChildEntity> children;
            }        </div>
</div>
<div class="style2">
    <h2>Set 2</h2>
    <div class="question">
        11. How does Lazy Loading affect performance in Hibernate applications?    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        Lazy Loading can improve performance by loading related entities only when accessed, reducing the number of database queries and the amount of data fetched. However, it can lead to performance issues if entities are accessed multiple times.    </div>

    <div class="question">
        12. Can you change the default fetching strategy in Hibernate?    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        Yes, the fetching strategy can be changed using annotations like `@ManyToOne(fetch = FetchType.LAZY)` for Lazy Loading or `@OneToMany(fetch = FetchType.EAGER)` for Eager Loading.    </div>

    <div class="question">
        13. How does Hibernate handle the session when using Lazy Loading?    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        Hibernate keeps the session open while lazily loading data. If the session is closed before accessing the lazy-loaded entity, a `LazyInitializationException` occurs.    </div>

    <div class="question">
        14. How can you solve the `LazyInitializationException` in Hibernate?    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        You can solve the `LazyInitializationException` by ensuring that the session remains open when accessing lazy-loaded entities or by using `@Transactional` to manage session handling in Spring.    </div>
    <div class="style7">
        @Transactional
        public void fetchData() {
            ParentEntity parent = parentRepository.findById(1L);
            Set<ChildEntity> children = parent.getChildren(); // No LazyInitializationException
        }    </div>

    <div class="question">
        15. What is the effect of `FetchType.LAZY` on relationships in Hibernate?    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        `FetchType.LAZY` delays the loading of related entities until they are explicitly accessed. It helps to avoid unnecessary database queries but can result in additional queries when the related entities are accessed.    </div>

    <div class="question">
        16. What is the default fetch type for `@ManyToOne` relationships in Hibernate?    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        The default fetch type for `@ManyToOne` relationships in Hibernate is `FetchType.EAGER`, meaning that related entities are fetched immediately with the parent entity.    </div>

    <div class="question">
        17. What is the `FetchMode` in Hibernate and how does it work with Lazy/Eager loading?    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        `FetchMode` in Hibernate defines how associated entities are fetched. `FetchMode.JOIN` fetches the related entity eagerly in a single query, while `FetchMode.SELECT` uses separate queries for each related entity (Lazy Loading).    </div>

    <div class="question">
        18. How does Hibernate decide which fetch strategy to use by default?    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        Hibernate decides the default fetch strategy based on the annotation or mapping configuration. For example, `@ManyToOne` defaults to `FetchType.EAGER`, and `@OneToMany` defaults to `FetchType.LAZY`.    </div>

    <div class="question">
        19. How can you optimize performance when using Lazy Loading with Hibernate?    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        Performance can be optimized by minimizing the number of queries (e.g., using `JOIN FETCH`), eagerly loading only the necessary entities, and using batch fetching strategies to load multiple entities at once.    </div>
    <div class="style8">
        @Query("SELECT p FROM ParentEntity p JOIN FETCH p.children")
        List<ParentEntity> findAllWithChildren();    </div>

    <div class="question">
        20. How does Hibernate handle the fetching of collections in Lazy Loading?    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        In Lazy Loading, Hibernate fetches collections (e.g., `List`, `Set`) when they are accessed for the first time. If not accessed, the collection will not be loaded, which can help reduce memory usage.    </div>
</div>
    <div class="style2">
        <h2>Set 3</h2>
        <div class="question">
            21. How can you specify Eager Loading in Hibernate?        </div>
        <div class="answer">
            Eager Loading can be specified using `@ManyToOne(fetch = FetchType.EAGER)` or `@OneToMany(fetch = FetchType.EAGER)` annotations, causing related entities to be fetched immediately.        </div>

        <div class="question">
            22. What is the default fetching strategy for `@OneToMany` in Hibernate?        </div>
        <div class="answer">
            The default fetching strategy for `@OneToMany` relationships in Hibernate is `FetchType.LAZY`, meaning the associated entities will not be fetched unless explicitly accessed.        </div>

        <div class="question">
            23. How can you override the default fetch type in Hibernate?        </div>
        <div class="answer">
            You can override the default fetch type by using the `fetch` attribute in the annotation. For example, `@OneToMany(fetch = FetchType.EAGER)` to eagerly fetch related entities.        </div>

        <div class="question">
            24. What is the difference between Lazy Loading and Eager Loading in terms of database queries?        </div>
        <div class="answer">
            Lazy Loading results in fewer database queries since related entities are loaded only when accessed, whereas Eager Loading fetches all related entities in a single query, which might increase the number of queries.        </div>

        <div class="question">
            25. How do you handle LazyInitializationException in Hibernate?        </div>
        <div class="answer">
            LazyInitializationException occurs when you try to access a lazily loaded entity outside the scope of the session. You can solve this by ensuring the session is open or by using `@Transactional`.        </div>

        <div class="question">
            26. Can Lazy Loading be used with collections in Hibernate?        </div>
        <div class="answer">
            Yes, Lazy Loading can be used with collections (e.g., `@OneToMany`). The collection is loaded only when it is accessed for the first time.        </div>

        <div class="question">
            27. What is `JOIN FETCH` in Hibernate and how does it relate to Lazy Loading?        </div>
        <div class="answer">
            `JOIN FETCH` is used in Hibernate queries to eagerly load associated entities in a single query. It overrides Lazy Loading and fetches related entities immediately, reducing the number of queries.        </div>
        <div class="style9">
            @Query("SELECT p FROM ParentEntity p JOIN FETCH p.children")
            List<ParentEntity> findAllWithChildren();        </div>

        <div class="question">
            28. What is the impact of using Lazy Loading on performance?        </div>
        <div class="answer">
            Lazy Loading can improve performance by reducing unnecessary database queries, but it may cause additional queries if related entities are frequently accessed after the initial loading.        </div>

        <div class="question">
            29. How can you change the fetch type for `@OneToMany` relationships in Hibernate?        </div>
        <div class="answer">
            You can change the fetch type for `@OneToMany` by specifying the `fetch` attribute in the annotation: `@OneToMany(fetch = FetchType.EAGER)` or `@OneToMany(fetch = FetchType.LAZY)`.        </div>

        <div class="question">
            30. How can you prevent Lazy Loading from causing N+1 query problems in Hibernate?        </div>
        <div class="answer">
            You can prevent N+1 query problems by using `JOIN FETCH` in HQL or JPQL to fetch related entities in a single query. Additionally, batch fetching can be enabled to fetch multiple entities at once.        </div>
</div>
    <div class="style2">
        <h2>Set 4</h2>
        <div class="question">
            31. What is the purpose of `@Transactional` in Hibernate when dealing with Lazy Loading?        </div>
        <div class="answer">
            `@Transactional` ensures that the session is open during the transaction, which allows Lazy Loading to fetch related entities without causing a `LazyInitializationException` after the session is closed.        </div>

        <div class="question">
            32. How can you fetch data eagerly using a query in Hibernate?        </div>
        <div class="answer">
            You can fetch data eagerly by using a `JOIN FETCH` clause in your HQL or JPQL query to load related entities immediately.        </div>
        <div class="style10">
            @Query("SELECT p FROM ParentEntity p JOIN FETCH p.children")
            List<ParentEntity> findAllWithChildren();        </div>

        <div class="question">
            33. What is the effect of `FetchType.LAZY` on `@ManyToOne` relationships?        </div>
        <div class="answer">
            `FetchType.LAZY` on `@ManyToOne` means that the related entity will not be fetched when the parent entity is loaded. It will only be fetched when explicitly accessed.        </div>

        <div class="question">
            34. Can you force Eager Loading for collections in Hibernate?        </div>
        <div class="answer">
            Yes, you can force Eager Loading for collections by using `@OneToMany(fetch = FetchType.EAGER)` or by using `JOIN FETCH` in your queries.        </div>

        <div class="question">
            35. What is the `LazyCollection` annotation used for in Hibernate?        </div>
        <div class="answer">
            The `LazyCollection` annotation is used to specify how collections are fetched. It is used with `@OneToMany` and `@ManyToMany` to indicate whether the collection should be fetched lazily or eagerly.        </div>

        <div class="question">
            36. How does Hibernate optimize Lazy Loading with `batch-fetching`?        </div>
        <div class="answer">
            Batch-fetching in Hibernate allows you to load related entities in batches instead of one by one, thus reducing the number of SQL queries when accessing multiple related entities.        </div>

        <div class="question">
            37. How can you configure batch-fetching in Hibernate?        </div>
        <div class="answer">
            Batch-fetching can be configured in the `hibernate.cfg.xml` file or in annotations by setting `hibernate.jdbc.batch_size` property.        </div>
        <div class="style11">
            hibernate.jdbc.batch_size=10        </div>

        <div class="question">
            38. What are the drawbacks of using Eager Loading in Hibernate?        </div>
        <div class="answer">
            Eager Loading can lead to performance issues by loading unnecessary data, especially in large datasets. It may cause a high memory load or increased database query times.        </div>

        <div class="question">
            39. What is the difference between `FetchType.EAGER` and `FetchType.LAZY` in terms of query execution?        </div>
        <div class="answer">
            `FetchType.EAGER` causes the related entities to be fetched in the same query as the parent entity, whereas `FetchType.LAZY` only loads related entities when accessed, potentially requiring additional queries.        </div>

        <div class="question">
            40. Can Hibernate automatically choose between Lazy and Eager loading based on usage patterns?        </div>
        <div class="answer">
            No, Hibernate does not automatically choose between Lazy and Eager loading. The fetch strategy needs to be specified explicitly using annotations or configurations.        </div>
</div>

    <div class="style2">
        <h2>Set 5</h2>
        <div class="question">
            41. What happens if you try to access a lazily-loaded entity outside the session in Hibernate?        </div>
        <div class="answer">
            If you try to access a lazily-loaded entity outside of the session, a `LazyInitializationException` is thrown because the session is closed and the entity cannot be fetched.        </div>

        <div class="question">
            42. What is the impact of using `FetchType.LAZY` on performance?        </div>
        <div class="answer">
            `FetchType.LAZY` can improve performance by delaying the loading of related entities until they are actually needed. However, it can cause performance issues if entities are accessed frequently, resulting in multiple database queries.        </div>

        <div class="question">
            43. How does Hibernate manage the session when using Lazy Loading?        </div>
        <div class="answer">
            Hibernate uses the session to fetch lazily-loaded entities. As long as the session is open, lazy-loaded associations can be fetched. If the session is closed, accessing lazy-loaded entities will trigger a `LazyInitializationException`.        </div>

        <div class="question">
            44. What is `FetchType.EAGER` and how does it affect performance?        </div>
        <div class="answer">
            `FetchType.EAGER` causes Hibernate to fetch related entities immediately with the parent entity. While this can reduce the number of queries, it may negatively impact performance by loading unnecessary data.        </div>

        <div class="question">
            45. What is the difference between eager and lazy fetching in terms of the SQL query generated?        </div>
        <div class="answer">
            In eager fetching, a `JOIN` is used in the SQL query to load both the parent and related entities in a single query. In lazy fetching, separate SQL queries are executed for the parent entity and its related entities when accessed.        </div>

        <div class="question">
            46. How can you prevent LazyInitializationException in Hibernate when using Lazy Loading?        </div>
        <div class="answer">
            You can prevent `LazyInitializationException` by ensuring that the session remains open when accessing lazily-loaded entities or by fetching related entities eagerly using `JOIN FETCH`.        </div>

        <div class="question">
            47. How can you use `@Fetch` in Hibernate to control the loading behavior of collections?        </div>
        <div class="answer">
            `@Fetch` is used to specify the fetching strategy for collections, such as `@Fetch(FetchMode.SELECT)` or `@Fetch(FetchMode.JOIN)`, to control how related entities are loaded.        </div>

        <div class="answer">
            In a `@ManyToOne` association, the associated entity is often loaded eagerly or lazily based on the fetch type configuration. In contrast, `@OneToMany` associations typically use lazy loading by default, unless explicitly set to eager loading, due to the potential overhead of loading large collections.        </div>

            When `@OneToOne(fetch = FetchType.EAGER)` is used, Hibernate loads the associated entity immediately along with the parent entity. This results in a single query fetching both entities, even if the associated entity is not needed in the current context.        </div>

        <div class="question">
            103. What is the role of `@Fetch(FetchMode.SELECT)` in Hibernate?        </div>
        <div class="answer">
            `@Fetch(FetchMode.SELECT)` configures Hibernate to fetch associated entities in separate queries, one for each association. This mode is useful when dealing with large collections and helps avoid the N+1 query problem by issuing optimized queries.        </div>

        <div class="question">
            104. What is the difference between `FetchType.LAZY` and `FetchType.EAGER` in Hibernate?        </div>
        <div class="answer">
            `FetchType.LAZY` defers the loading of the associated entity or collection until it is accessed, while `FetchType.EAGER` loads the associated entity or collection immediately when the parent entity is loaded, which can impact performance when dealing with large datasets.        </div>

        <div class="question">
            105. How does Hibernate's `@OneToMany` annotation with `fetch = FetchType.LAZY` help with performance optimization?        </div>
        <div class="answer">
            `fetch = FetchType.LAZY` helps with performance by deferring the loading of associated collections until they are explicitly accessed, reducing the number of database queries and preventing unnecessary data from being fetched.        </div>

        <div class="question">
            106. What are the possible causes of the `LazyInitializationException` in Hibernate?        </div>
        <div class="answer">
            `LazyInitializationException` occurs when a lazy-loaded association is accessed outside the scope of an open Hibernate session. This typically happens when the session is closed before the associated entity is accessed, or when the entity is detached.        </div>

        <div class="question">
            107. How can you prevent the `LazyInitializationException` from occurring in a Spring application?        </div>
        <div class="answer">
            You can prevent `LazyInitializationException` by using the `@Transactional` annotation, which ensures that the session remains open while the entity is accessed. Alternatively, you can initialize lazy-loaded collections explicitly using `Hibernate.initialize()` before closing the session.        </div>

        <div class="question">
            108. What is the impact of using `FetchType.EAGER` in terms of database performance?        </div>
        <div class="answer">
            Using `FetchType.EAGER` can impact database performance by loading all associated entities or collections immediately, which can lead to large, inefficient queries and unnecessary data retrieval. It is best used when the associated entities are always required.        </div>

        <div class="question">
            109. How can you customize the fetch strategy in Hibernate using HQL or JPQL?        </div>
        <div class="answer">
            You can customize the fetch strategy in HQL or JPQL using `JOIN FETCH` to eagerly fetch associated entities, or by using `LEFT JOIN FETCH` to include associations in the result set while avoiding N+1 query issues. These strategies help control how associations are loaded.        </div>
    </div>

        <div class="question">
            110. How can you use `@ManyToMany` with `fetch = FetchType.LAZY` to reduce memory consumption in Hibernate?        </div>
        <div class="answer">
            By using `fetch = FetchType.LAZY`, Hibernate will only load the related entities in a `@ManyToMany` relationship when they are actually accessed, reducing memory consumption and avoiding unnecessary data retrieval when the associated entities are not required.        </div>

        <div class="question">
            111. What happens when you use `fetch = FetchType.EAGER` with `@ManyToOne` in Hibernate?        </div>
        <div class="answer">
            When you use `fetch = FetchType.EAGER` with `@ManyToOne`, Hibernate will fetch the associated entity immediately when the parent entity is loaded, which can lead to performance issues if the associated entity is not needed in all cases.        </div>

        <div class="question">
            112. Can you switch between `FetchType.LAZY` and `FetchType.EAGER` dynamically in Hibernate? How?        </div>
        <div class="answer">
            You cannot directly switch between `FetchType.LAZY` and `FetchType.EAGER` dynamically using annotations. However, you can control the fetch strategy at runtime by using `Criteria` or `JPQL` with `JOIN FETCH` to customize fetching behavior based on specific use cases.        </div>

        <div class="question">
            113. How does Hibernate optimize fetch strategies with `@ManyToOne` and `@OneToMany` relationships?        </div>
        <div class="answer">
            Hibernate optimizes fetch strategies by deferring the loading of associated entities in `@ManyToOne` (with `FetchType.LAZY`) and `@OneToMany` (with `FetchType.LAZY`), preventing unnecessary queries. Additionally, you can use `@Fetch(FetchMode.JOIN)` to optimize fetch strategies and reduce the number of queries.        </div>

        <div class="question">
            114. What is the purpose of `@BatchSize` in Hibernate, and how does it relate to lazy loading?        </div>
        <div class="answer">
            The `@BatchSize` annotation in Hibernate allows you to specify the number of entities to load in a single batch when fetching associations lazily. This helps optimize performance by reducing the number of database round trips when loading collections or associations.        </div>

        <div class="question">
            115. How can you configure lazy loading for collections in Hibernate using `@OneToMany` and `@ManyToOne` associations?        </div>
        <div class="answer">
            You can configure lazy loading for collections in Hibernate by using `fetch = FetchType.LAZY` in `@OneToMany` and `@ManyToOne` annotations. This ensures that associated collections are only loaded when accessed, reducing the number of queries and improving performance.        </div>

        <div class="question">
            116. How can you optimize lazy loading in Hibernate for large collections using `@OneToMany` relationships?        </div>
        <div class="answer">
            To optimize lazy loading for large collections, you can use `@BatchSize` to load multiple associations in a single batch or configure `@Fetch(FetchMode.SUBSELECT)` to minimize the number of queries. These strategies reduce overhead and optimize performance when working with large datasets.        </div>

        <div class="question">
            117. What is the `@LazyCollection` annotation in Hibernate, and how does it help with lazy loading?        </div>
        <div class="answer">
            The `@LazyCollection` annotation in Hibernate allows you to control the lazy loading behavior of collections, specifying whether the collection should be loaded lazily using a proxy or eagerly. This annotation is useful when you want fine-grained control over the fetching strategy for collections.        </div>

        <div class="question">
            118. What are some common mistakes when using lazy loading in Hibernate?        </div>
        <div class="answer">
            Common mistakes include not managing session scope correctly (leading to `LazyInitializationException`), not using `@Transactional` to keep sessions open, or overusing `FetchType.EAGER` leading to inefficient queries and unnecessary data loading.        </div>
