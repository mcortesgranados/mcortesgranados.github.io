A dynamic proxy in Java is a class that implements one or more interfaces at runtime and delegates method calls to an `InvocationHandler`. It allows you to create proxies for interfaces without explicitly defining a subclass.

How do you create a dynamic proxy in Java?
To create a dynamic proxy, use the `Proxy.newProxyInstance()` method.

What is an `InvocationHandler` in Java?
An `InvocationHandler` is an interface that handles method invocations on proxy instances. It provides the `invoke()` method that is called when a method is invoked on a proxy object.
