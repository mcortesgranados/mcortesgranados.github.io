What is the Java Collections Framework?
The Java Collections Framework (JCF) is a set of interfaces and classes in `java.util` that provide data structures and algorithms for storing, managing, and manipulating collections of objects efficiently.

What are the main interfaces in the Java Collections Framework?
The main interfaces in the JCF are:

`Collection` (superinterface of all collections)
`List` (ordered collection with duplicates)
`Set` (unordered collection without duplicates)
`Map` (key-value pair collection)
`Queue` (FIFO structure for processing elements)
`Deque` (double-ended queue allowing operations on both ends)

What is the difference between `List`, `Set`, and `Map`?


`List`: Ordered collection that allows duplicate elements.
`Set`: Unordered collection that does not allow duplicate elements.
`Map`: Collection that stores key-value pairs, where keys are unique.
What are some common implementations of `List` in Java?
Common `List` implementations include:

`ArrayList` - Dynamic array implementation
`LinkedList` - Doubly linked list implementation
`Vector` - Synchronized dynamic array
`Stack` - LIFO stack implementation (extends `Vector`)

`ArrayList`: Uses dynamic arrays, provides fast random access (`O(1)`) but slow insertions and deletions (`O(n)`).
`LinkedList`: Uses a doubly linked list, provides fast insertions and deletions (`O(1)`) but slow random access (`O(n)`).
