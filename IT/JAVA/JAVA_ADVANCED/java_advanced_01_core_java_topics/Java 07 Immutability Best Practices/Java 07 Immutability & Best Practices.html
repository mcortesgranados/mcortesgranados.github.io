<ol class="style1">
  <li> <strong>What is immutability in Java?</strong><br />
      <p><em>Answer:</em> Immutability refers to the concept where once an object is created, its state cannot be modified. In Java, immutable objects are typically used to ensure thread safety and to maintain integrity by preventing modifications after the object’s creation.</p>
  </li>
  <li> <strong>Why are immutable objects preferred in multi-threaded environments?</strong><br />
      <p><em>Answer:</em> Immutable objects are preferred because they can be safely shared between threads without the risk of concurrent modifications, which eliminates synchronization issues and enhances thread safety.</p>
  </li>
  <li> <strong>How can you create an immutable class in Java?</strong><br />
      <p><em>Answer:</em> To create an immutable class, you should define final classes, final fields, and provide getters without setters. Additionally, ensure that fields that are references to mutable objects are not directly exposed.</p>
  </li>
  <li> <strong>Can you modify the state of an immutable object once it is created?</strong><br />
      <p><em>Answer:</em> No, the state of an immutable object cannot be modified after it is created. All fields are final and cannot be changed once the object is initialized.</p>
  </li>
  <li> <strong>What is the purpose of the `final` keyword in creating immutable classes?</strong><br />
      <p><em>Answer:</em> The `final` keyword is used to prevent the object’s state from being changed. It ensures that fields cannot be reassigned and classes cannot be subclassed, which helps in maintaining immutability.</p>
  </li>
  <li> <strong>What is the role of defensive copying in immutability?</strong><br />
      <p><em>Answer:</em> Defensive copying is used when an immutable object contains references to mutable objects. By creating copies of the mutable objects, it ensures that the original object’s state cannot be altered from outside the class.</p>
  </li>
  <li> <strong>Why should mutable fields not be exposed in immutable objects?</strong><br />
      <p><em>Answer:</em> Exposing mutable fields directly in an immutable object would allow external code to modify the object’s state, which would violate the concept of immutability. Instead, only copies of mutable objects should be exposed.</p>
  </li>
  <li> <strong>Can you use mutable collections in immutable objects?</strong><br />
      <p><em>Answer:</em> No, mutable collections should not be used in immutable objects. If collections are needed, you should either use unmodifiable collections (e.g., `Collections.unmodifiableList()`) or make a defensive copy of the collection.</p>
  </li>
  <li> <strong>What is the `String` class in Java, and why is it immutable?</strong><br />
      <p><em>Answer:</em> The `String` class is immutable in Java, meaning that once a `String` object is created, its value cannot be changed. This design ensures security, performance, and thread safety. String literals are cached for efficiency.</p>
  </li>
  <li> <strong>What is the impact of immutability on performance?</strong><br />
      <p><em>Answer:</em> Immutability can have both positive and negative impacts on performance. On the positive side, immutable objects can be cached and reused, which may improve performance. However, defensive copying and the need for additional memory allocation may introduce overhead.</p>

<h1 class="style1">Immutability &amp; Best Practices - Questions &amp; Answers</h1>
<h2 class="style1">Set 2</h2>
<ol class="style1">
  <li> <strong>What is a best practice for designing immutable classes?</strong><br />
      <p><em>Answer:</em> A best practice for designing immutable classes includes making the class `final`, declaring fields as `final`, providing a constructor that initializes all fields, and not providing setter methods.</p>
  </li>
  <li> <strong>What is a potential downside of using immutable objects in certain scenarios?</strong><br />
      <p><em>Answer:</em> A potential downside is that creating new objects every time you need to change state (due to immutability) can lead to increased memory consumption and might introduce performance overhead in highly dynamic applications.</p>
  </li>
  <li> <strong>How does immutability contribute to thread safety?</strong><br />
      <p><em>Answer:</em> Immutability ensures that an object’s state cannot be modified after it’s created, preventing race conditions in multi-threaded environments since multiple threads can safely share immutable objects without synchronization.</p>
  </li>
  <li> <strong>Is the `Integer` class in Java immutable?</strong><br />
      <p><em>Answer:</em> Yes, the `Integer` class in Java is immutable. Once an `Integer` object is created, its value cannot be changed.</p>
  </li>
  <li> <strong>What is a &quot;builder pattern&quot; and how does it help in creating immutable objects?</strong><br />
      <p><em>Answer:</em> The builder pattern provides a flexible way to construct immutable objects by separating the construction process from the actual class. It allows you to set properties in a step-by-step manner while ensuring that the object remains immutable after construction.</p>
  </li>
  <li> <strong>Can immutable objects be subclassed in Java?</strong><br />
      <p><em>Answer:</em> Yes, immutable objects can be subclassed in Java. However, it’s important to ensure that the subclass also adheres to the immutability rules (i.e., making fields final and not providing setter methods).</p>
  </li>
  <li> <strong>What is the difference between a mutable and an immutable collection in Java?</strong><br />
      <p><em>Answer:</em> A mutable collection allows modifications (like adding, removing, or changing elements), while an immutable collection prevents any such changes after it is created. For immutability, you can use collections like `Collections.unmodifiableList()` or `List.of()` (Java 9+).</p>
  </li>
  <li> <strong>What happens if an immutable object contains a reference to a mutable object?</strong><br />
      <p><em>Answer:</em> If an immutable object contains a reference to a mutable object, you must make a defensive copy of the mutable object to ensure that the external code cannot modify it. Otherwise, the immutability of the class may be compromised.</p>
  </li>
  <li> <strong>What is a practical use case for immutable objects in Java?</strong><br />
      <p><em>Answer:</em> A practical use case for immutable objects is when dealing with configurations, value objects, or data transfer objects (DTOs) where the state of the object should not change once it's constructed, such as in multi-threaded environments or caching mechanisms.</p>
  </li>
  <li> <strong>What is the best practice for dealing with `null` values in immutable objects?</strong><br />
      <p><em>Answer:</em> It is generally a good practice to avoid `null` values in immutable objects. If a field can be `null`, it’s better to use an `Optional` to make it explicit and avoid potential `NullPointerExceptions`.</p>

<h1 class="style1">Immutability &amp; Best Practices - Questions &amp; Answers</h1>
<h2 class="style1">Set 3</h2>
<ol class="style1">
  <li> <strong>How can you make a `List` immutable in Java?</strong><br />
      <p><em>Answer:</em> You can make a `List` immutable in Java by using methods like `Collections.unmodifiableList()` or using the `List.of()` method (introduced in Java 9), which returns an unmodifiable list.</p>
  </li>
  <li> <strong>What is the main benefit of using immutable objects in functional programming?</strong><br />
      <p><em>Answer:</em> The main benefit is that immutable objects enable referential transparency, meaning that functions using immutable data always produce the same result for the same input, making programs easier to reason about and test.</p>
  </li>
  <li> <strong>How do immutable objects improve security?</strong><br />
      <p><em>Answer:</em> Immutable objects improve security by preventing unauthorized changes to their state. Since the data cannot be modified after construction, sensitive information remains intact and cannot be tampered with.</p>
  </li>
  <li> <strong>Why is immutability an important concept in Java 8 and beyond?</strong><br />
      <p><em>Answer:</em> Immutability is important in Java 8 and beyond because it aligns well with functional programming concepts like statelessness, which is a key feature of stream processing and lambda expressions. It also supports safe parallel and concurrent programming.</p>
  </li>
  <li> <strong>What is the effect of making a class immutable in terms of garbage collection?</strong><br />
      <p><em>Answer:</em> Immutability can improve garbage collection efficiency since immutable objects can be safely shared between threads, leading to fewer allocations and reduced memory usage. Once an immutable object is no longer in use, it can be quickly garbage collected.</p>
  </li>
  <li> <strong>Can immutable objects be used in a cache?</strong><br />
      <p><em>Answer:</em> Yes, immutable objects are ideal for caching because they do not change over time. Once cached, the same object can be safely used without the risk of unexpected changes.</p>
  </li>
  <li> <strong>What is the role of `Optional` in immutability?</strong><br />
      <p><em>Answer:</em> `Optional` can be used to represent values that may or may not be present without using `null`. It allows for more expressive and safer handling of optional values in immutable objects.</p>
  </li>
  <li> <strong>What are the downsides of using `Optional` in immutable objects?</strong><br />
      <p><em>Answer:</em> Overuse of `Optional` can introduce unnecessary complexity and may cause performance overhead, especially if used in fields that do not require it. It’s best to use `Optional` in cases where the absence of a value is a significant aspect of the design.</p>
  </li>
  <li> <strong>What are the typical use cases for immutable objects in Java?</strong><br />
      <p><em>Answer:</em> Typical use cases for immutable objects include value objects, DTOs (Data Transfer Objects), and configurations that are set once and should not change, such as a user profile or application settings.</p>
  </li>
  <li> <strong>What is the primary advantage of making your objects immutable in terms of debugging?</strong><br />
      <p><em>Answer:</em> Immutability simplifies debugging since immutable objects are not modified after their creation, which eliminates many potential sources of bugs, such as side effects and unexpected state changes.</p>
  </li>

<h1 class="style1">Immutability &amp; Best Practices - Questions &amp; Answers</h1>
<h2 class="style1">Set 4</h2>
<ol class="style1">
  <li> <strong>How do you prevent subclassing of an immutable class?</strong><br />
      <p><em>Answer:</em> To prevent subclassing of an immutable class, declare the class as `final`. This ensures that no other class can extend it and potentially override its behavior.</p>
  </li>
  <li> <strong>Why is `String` considered immutable in Java?</strong><br />
      <p><em>Answer:</em> `String` is immutable in Java because its value cannot be changed after it is created. Any operation that seems to modify a `String` actually creates a new `String` object, leaving the original one unchanged.</p>
  </li>
  <li> <strong>What is the impact of immutability on memory usage?</strong><br />
      <p><em>Answer:</em> While immutable objects generally require more memory due to the creation of new objects when their state changes, they can also reduce memory overhead in scenarios involving shared objects, as the state cannot be altered once set.</p>
  </li>
  <li> <strong>What is a &quot;defensive copy&quot; and why is it important when working with mutable fields in immutable objects?</strong><br />
      <p><em>Answer:</em> A defensive copy is a technique used to ensure that mutable objects contained in an immutable object cannot be modified by external code. This involves creating a copy of the mutable object during construction and any getters, to ensure that the original object is protected.</p>
  </li>
  <li> <strong>How can you implement immutability in Java with `final` and `private` keywords?</strong><br />
      <p><em>Answer:</em> To implement immutability, declare all fields as `final` so that their values can only be set once. Use `private` for field visibility to prevent direct modification from outside the class, and provide only getters to access the field values.</p>
  </li>
  <li> <strong>What are the limitations of immutability in real-world applications?</strong><br />
      <p><em>Answer:</em> The limitations of immutability include performance overhead in scenarios where frequent object creation is necessary, especially for mutable fields. Additionally, some design patterns, like the Builder pattern, may require additional complexity to maintain immutability.</p>
  </li>
  <li> <strong>Can immutable objects be used with Java's `Collections` framework?</strong><br />
      <p><em>Answer:</em> Yes, immutable objects can be used with Java's `Collections` framework. For instance, you can create an immutable list using `Collections.unmodifiableList()`. However, collections that contain mutable elements should be handled carefully to maintain the overall immutability of the object.</p>
  </li>
  <li> <strong>Why does immutability help in concurrent programming?</strong><br />
      <p><em>Answer:</em> Immutability helps in concurrent programming because immutable objects do not change after they are created. This eliminates the need for synchronization when multiple threads access the same object, as there is no risk of data inconsistency due to modifications.</p>
  </li>
  <li> <strong>What is the importance of `toString()` method in immutable classes?</strong><br />
      <p><em>Answer:</em> The `toString()` method in immutable classes is important because it provides a string representation of the object's state, which is helpful for debugging and logging purposes. Since the object's state cannot change, the `toString()` method will consistently return the same output.</p>
  </li>
  <li> <strong>What is the relationship between immutability and functional programming?</strong><br />
      <p><em>Answer:</em> Immutability is a key concept in functional programming because it helps avoid side effects, which makes the functions predictable and testable. Functional programming promotes the use of immutable data structures, enabling safer concurrent execution and easier reasoning about code.</p>
  </li>

<h1 class="style1">Immutability &amp; Best Practices - Questions &amp; Answers</h1>
<h2 class="style1">Set 5</h2>
<ol class="style1">
  <li> <strong>How does immutability impact garbage collection?</strong><br />
      <p><em>Answer:</em> Immutability can make garbage collection more efficient by enabling shared use of objects without the need for synchronization. Once an immutable object is no longer referenced, it can be safely garbage collected without concerns of being altered in another thread.</p>
  </li>
  <li> <strong>What are the performance trade-offs of immutability?</strong><br />
      <p><em>Answer:</em> The performance trade-offs of immutability include potential overhead from creating new objects rather than modifying existing ones. In scenarios with frequent state changes, this can lead to increased memory usage and garbage collection pressure.</p>
  </li>
  <li> <strong>Can immutable objects be serialized in Java?</strong><br />
      <p><em>Answer:</em> Yes, immutable objects can be serialized in Java, just like mutable objects. However, when designing an immutable class, you should ensure that the class is compatible with serialization and its state is properly captured during serialization.</p>
  </li>
  <li> <strong>What are the main principles for designing immutable classes in Java?</strong><br />
      <p><em>Answer:</em> The main principles for designing immutable classes in Java include declaring the class as `final`, making fields `private` and `final`, providing getters for fields but no setters, and ensuring that fields cannot be changed after the object's construction.</p>
  </li>
  <li> <strong>What is the difference between `StringBuilder` and `String` in terms of mutability?</strong><br />
      <p><em>Answer:</em> `String` is immutable, meaning once created, its value cannot be changed. `StringBuilder` is mutable and allows the value of the string to be modified using methods like `append()`, `insert()`, and `delete()`. `StringBuilder` is more efficient for string manipulation in certain cases.</p>
  </li>
  <li> <strong>How does immutability support better debugging?</strong><br />
      <p><em>Answer:</em> Immutability supports better debugging by ensuring that objects cannot change state unexpectedly. This eliminates one class of bugs related to unintended state modifications, making the system's behavior more predictable and easier to trace.</p>
  </li>
  <li> <strong>What is a `CopyOnWriteArrayList` and how does it support immutability?</strong><br />
      <p><em>Answer:</em> `CopyOnWriteArrayList` is a thread-safe variant of `ArrayList` where all mutative operations (such as `add`, `remove`) result in a new copy of the underlying array being created. This allows safe reads while avoiding synchronization, which is useful in situations where reads dominate over writes.</p>
  </li>
  <li> <strong>How does immutability help in designing distributed systems?</strong><br />
      <p><em>Answer:</em> Immutability helps in distributed systems by reducing the potential for race conditions and state inconsistencies. Since immutable objects cannot be modified once created, they can be safely passed between components without the risk of unintended side effects.</p>
  </li>
  <li> <strong>What is the difference between shallow and deep copies in terms of immutability?</strong><br />
      <p><em>Answer:</em> A shallow copy copies the references of the objects within the original object, meaning the inner objects are shared. A deep copy, on the other hand, creates copies of the inner objects as well. For immutable objects, deep copies are often used to ensure that mutable objects contained within the immutable object cannot be modified.</p>
  </li>
  <li> <strong>How do you handle mutable fields in an immutable class?</strong><br />
      <p><em>Answer:</em> To handle mutable fields in an immutable class, you should make a defensive copy of the mutable object during construction and when returning the object in any getter methods. This ensures that the mutable object cannot be modified externally.</p>
  </li>

<h1 class="style1">Immutability &amp; Best Practices - Questions &amp; Answers</h1>
<h2 class="style1">Set 6</h2>
<ol class="style1">
  <li> <strong>What are the advantages of using `final` in immutability?</strong><br />
      <p><em>Answer:</em> The `final` keyword ensures that once a reference is assigned, it cannot be reassigned to another object. This is essential for immutability as it prevents the object reference from being changed after the object is constructed.</p>
  </li>
  <li> <strong>How does immutability relate to thread safety?</strong><br />
      <p><em>Answer:</em> Immutability enhances thread safety because immutable objects cannot be altered once they are created. This ensures that they can be safely shared across threads without the need for synchronization, as their state cannot change unexpectedly.</p>
  </li>
  <li> <strong>What is the impact of immutability on performance in high-concurrency applications?</strong><br />
      <p><em>Answer:</em> Immutability can improve performance in high-concurrency applications by reducing the need for locks or synchronization. Since immutable objects do not change, they can be accessed concurrently without the risk of data corruption or contention.</p>
  </li>
  <li> <strong>What is a good use case for immutable objects in Java?</strong><br />
      <p><em>Answer:</em> A good use case for immutable objects in Java is when you need to represent data that should not be altered once it is created, such as `String`, `LocalDate`, and other value objects in domain-driven design. They ensure consistency and simplify reasoning about the program.</p>
  </li>
  <li> <strong>Can immutable objects be inherited?</strong><br />
      <p><em>Answer:</em> Yes, immutable objects can be inherited, but the child class must also be designed to be immutable. This can be achieved by ensuring that fields are final and providing no setter methods in the child class.</p>
  </li>
  <li> <strong>What is the role of immutability in functional programming?</strong><br />
      <p><em>Answer:</em> In functional programming, immutability is a core concept. It helps ensure that functions do not have side effects and that data is not altered unexpectedly. This leads to more predictable and easier-to-debug programs.</p>
  </li>
  <li> <strong>How does immutability improve code maintainability?</strong><br />
      <p><em>Answer:</em> Immutability improves code maintainability by eliminating issues caused by mutable state. Since objects cannot be modified after creation, they can be used safely throughout the code without worrying about unintended changes, making the code easier to understand and debug.</p>
  </li>
  <li> <strong>How do you create an immutable collection in Java?</strong><br />
      <p><em>Answer:</em> You can create an immutable collection in Java by using classes such as `List.of()` or `Set.of()` introduced in Java 9. These collections are unmodifiable, meaning any attempt to modify them will result in an `UnsupportedOperationException`.</p>
  </li>
  <li> <strong>What is the role of the `Collections.unmodifiableList` method in creating immutable collections?</strong><br />
      <p><em>Answer:</em> The `Collections.unmodifiableList` method creates an immutable view of a list. It allows you to wrap a mutable list into an unmodifiable list, ensuring that any modification attempts will result in an exception.</p>
  </li>
  <li> <strong>How can you ensure that an immutable class can be safely used with serialization?</strong><br />
      <p><em>Answer:</em> To ensure an immutable class can be safely used with serialization, you should implement `Serializable` and handle object deserialization properly. You must ensure that the class cannot be modified after deserialization by using `readObject` to enforce immutability.</p>
  </li>

<h1 class="style1">Immutability &amp; Best Practices - Questions &amp; Answers</h1>
<h2 class="style1">Set 7</h2>
<ol class="style1">
  <li> <strong>How do you define an immutable class in Java?</strong><br />
      <p><em>Answer:</em> To define an immutable class in Java, you need to ensure the following: </p>
    <ul>
        <li>All fields should be private and final.</li>
      <li>Provide only getters, no setters.</li>
      <li>Ensure that no methods can modify the state of the object.</li>
      <li>Ensure that mutable objects are either cloned or defensively copied if passed as arguments or returned.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
  </li>
  <li> <strong>Why should the `clone()` method not be used in immutable objects?</strong><br />
      <p><em>Answer:</em> The `clone()` method is typically not used in immutable objects because it can break immutability if a reference to a mutable object within the immutable class is shared. Instead, defensive copying should be used to ensure that mutable fields are not directly exposed.</p>
  </li>
  <li> <strong>How can immutability improve security in an application?</strong><br />
      <p><em>Answer:</em> Immutability improves security by ensuring that objects cannot be altered once they are created, preventing malicious code from changing their state. This makes it harder for attackers to manipulate critical data in an unpredictable way.</p>
  </li>
  <li> <strong>What happens when you try to modify an immutable object?</strong><br />
      <p><em>Answer:</em> When you try to modify an immutable object, it typically throws an `UnsupportedOperationException` (if the object is part of an unmodifiable collection) or doesn't allow any modifications to its fields, resulting in no changes.</p>
  </li>
  <li> <strong>How does immutability affect memory management in Java?</strong><br />
      <p><em>Answer:</em> Immutability can affect memory management by reducing the need for defensive copies of objects. Since immutable objects do not change, they can be shared safely without requiring additional memory for copies, leading to more efficient memory usage.</p>
  </li>
  <li> <strong>Can immutable objects be modified through reflection?</strong><br />
      <p><em>Answer:</em> While it is technically possible to modify immutable objects through reflection (e.g., by setting private fields), doing so violates the principles of immutability and should be avoided. Reflection should be used with caution in such cases.</p>
  </li>
  <li> <strong>What is the difference between a `final` class and an immutable class?</strong><br />
      <p><em>Answer:</em> A `final` class cannot be subclassed, whereas an immutable class refers to an object whose state cannot be changed once it is created. A class can be both `final` and immutable, but they are not synonymous. Immutability focuses on object state, while `final` focuses on class inheritance.</p>
  </li>
  <li> <strong>What are the best practices for using `StringBuilder` in Java when working with immutability?</strong><br />
      <p><em>Answer:</em> The best practice is to avoid using `StringBuilder` for immutability. Since `StringBuilder` is mutable, it should be used carefully. For immutable string manipulation, use `String` or `StringBuilder` and convert to `String` when necessary. However, for high-performance scenarios, `StringBuilder` can still be used internally and then converted to `String`.</p>
  </li>
  <li> <strong>Why should you avoid using public setters in immutable classes?</strong><br />
      <p><em>Answer:</em> Public setters allow the state of an object to be modified after its creation, which violates immutability. To maintain immutability, you should avoid providing setters and only allow the state to be set through the constructor or methods that do not alter the object's state.</p>
  </li>
  <li> <strong>Can an immutable object have a mutable field?</strong><br />
      <p><em>Answer:</em> No, an immutable object should not have mutable fields. If a mutable field is necessary, it should either be final and not change after construction or be defensively copied during the object creation to prevent external modifications.</p>

<h1 class="style1">Immutability &amp; Best Practices - Questions &amp; Answers</h1>
<h2 class="style1">Set 8</h2>
<ol class="style1">
  <li> <strong>What is the benefit of immutability in multi-threaded applications?</strong><br />
      <p><em>Answer:</em> In multi-threaded applications, immutability eliminates the need for synchronization because immutable objects cannot be modified. This leads to safer code with fewer chances for race conditions, as multiple threads can safely access the same object without the need for locks.</p>
  </li>
  <li> <strong>What is a defensive copy and why is it important for immutability?</strong><br />
      <p><em>Answer:</em> A defensive copy is a copy of a mutable object that is created to prevent it from being modified externally. It is important for immutability because it ensures that the internal state of an immutable object cannot be changed by external code after the object has been created.</p>
  </li>
  <li> <strong>How do you handle mutable objects in an immutable class?</strong><br />
      <p><em>Answer:</em> In an immutable class, mutable objects should be copied either via cloning or by using a constructor that accepts a defensive copy. This ensures that the mutable object’s state cannot be modified after the immutable object is created.</p>
  </li>
  <li> <strong>What are the performance implications of using immutable objects?</strong><br />
      <p><em>Answer:</em> While immutable objects can offer thread safety and simplicity in design, they may cause performance overhead due to the need for creating new instances instead of modifying existing ones. However, they can improve cache utilization and reduce the complexity of code, leading to fewer bugs and easier maintenance.</p>
  </li>
  <li> <strong>What is a typical use case where immutability is beneficial?</strong><br />
      <p><em>Answer:</em> Immutability is especially beneficial in scenarios where objects are shared across different parts of an application or between threads, such as configurations, value objects, and domain objects. It simplifies the design and reduces the chances of unintended side-effects.</p>
  </li>
  <li> <strong>Can you mutate the fields of an immutable class if it contains mutable fields?</strong><br />
      <p><em>Answer:</em> No, even if an immutable class contains mutable fields, the object itself cannot be mutated. However, the mutable fields should be cloned or copied to prevent external changes. If a mutable field is directly referenced, the object will not be truly immutable.</p>
  </li>
  <li> <strong>How does immutability relate to functional programming?</strong><br />
      <p><em>Answer:</em> Immutability is a core principle of functional programming, which encourages the use of immutable data structures. In functional programming, data is never modified, but instead, new data is returned from functions. This minimizes side effects and makes programs easier to reason about.</p>
  </li>
  <li> <strong>What is the impact of immutability on object equality checks in Java?</strong><br />
      <p><em>Answer:</em> Since immutable objects do not change, their equality checks are more predictable. Immutability ensures that objects remain in a consistent state, so equality checks can be done reliably using the `equals()` method without worrying about changes to the object.</p>
  </li>
  <li> <strong>How do you implement an immutable class with a collection in Java?</strong><br />
      <p><em>Answer:</em> To implement an immutable class that contains a collection, you should ensure that the collection itself is either unmodifiable or a defensive copy is made when the collection is passed into the class or returned. This prevents external modification of the collection.</p>
  </li>
  <li> <strong>Why is it important to return `Collections.unmodifiableList()` instead of the actual list in immutable classes?</strong><br />
      <p><em>Answer:</em> Returning `Collections.unmodifiableList()` ensures that the list cannot be modified from outside the immutable class. If you return the actual list, external code could change the list's contents, which would violate the immutability of the class.</p>

<h2 class="style1">Set 9</h2>
<ol class="style1">
  <li> <strong>Can an immutable class have static fields?</strong><br />
      <p><em>Answer:</em> Yes, an immutable class can have static fields, but those fields should also be immutable or final to ensure that they cannot be modified.</p>
  </li>
  <li> <strong>How does immutability affect garbage collection?</strong><br />
      <p><em>Answer:</em> Immutability can reduce memory leaks because immutable objects do not hold references to mutable objects that can change over time. It also allows objects to be garbage collected more easily since they are not modified.</p>
  </li>
  <li> <strong>Why is immutability recommended in API design?</strong><br />
      <p><em>Answer:</em> Immutability simplifies API design by ensuring that objects are thread-safe, easy to use, and do not introduce unintended side effects. This makes APIs more predictable and easier to maintain.</p>
  </li>
  <li> <strong>Can we make an immutable class final in Java?</strong><br />
      <p><em>Answer:</em> Yes, it is recommended to make an immutable class final to prevent it from being subclassed and having its behavior altered, which could compromise immutability.</p>
  </li>
  <li> <strong>How do immutable objects help in caching?</strong><br />
      <p><em>Answer:</em> Since immutable objects do not change, they can be safely cached and reused without worrying about inconsistent states, reducing memory usage and improving performance.</p>
  </li>
  <li> <strong>What happens when you pass an immutable object as a method parameter?</strong><br />
      <p><em>Answer:</em> When an immutable object is passed as a parameter, only its reference is passed, but since the object itself cannot be modified, its state remains unchanged.</p>
  </li>
  <li> <strong>What are some common pitfalls when designing an immutable class?</strong><br />
      <p><em>Answer:</em> Some common pitfalls include exposing mutable fields, not making defensive copies of collections, and allowing subclassing that can modify the object’s state.</p>
  </li>
  <li> <strong>How do you handle immutability with large objects to avoid performance issues?</strong><br />
      <p><em>Answer:</em> Instead of creating new large objects for each change, you can use techniques like structural sharing (used in functional programming) or builders that create objects in a single step.</p>
  </li>
  <li> <strong>Can an immutable object contain mutable objects internally?</strong><br />
      <p><em>Answer:</em> Yes, but the mutable objects should never be exposed or modified after the immutable object is created. Defensive copies should be used when necessary.</p>
  </li>
  <li> <strong>How do you make a class immutable with collections?</strong><br />
      <p><em>Answer:</em> You should create unmodifiable views using `Collections.unmodifiableList()`, `Collections.unmodifiableSet()`, etc., or use defensive copies when returning or accepting collections.</p>
  </li>

<h1 class="style1">Immutability &amp; Best Practices - Questions &amp; Answers</h1>
<h2 class="style1">Set 10</h2>
<ol class="style1">
  <li> <strong>How does immutability help in functional programming?</strong><br />
      <p><em>Answer:</em> Immutability is a core principle of functional programming as it prevents side effects, making functions pure and predictable, which simplifies debugging and testing.</p>
  </li>
  <li> <strong>Can we create an immutable class without using the final keyword?</strong><br />
      <p><em>Answer:</em> Yes, immutability can be achieved without the `final` keyword, but using `final` prevents subclassing, which helps enforce immutability more strictly.</p>
  </li>
  <li> <strong>How can immutability impact multithreading performance?</strong><br />
      <p><em>Answer:</em> Immutability eliminates the need for synchronization in multi-threaded environments, improving performance and reducing the risk of concurrency issues.</p>
  </li>
  <li> <strong>Can we store mutable objects inside an immutable class?</strong><br />
      <p><em>Answer:</em> Yes, but you must ensure they are not modified after object creation, either by using defensive copying or wrapping them in unmodifiable views.</p>
  </li>
  <li> <strong>How does Java's String class demonstrate immutability?</strong><br />
      <p><em>Answer:</em> Java's `String` class is immutable because its value is stored in a `final` array of characters, and any modification creates a new string instead of modifying the existing one.</p>
  </li>
  <li> <strong>How do wrapper classes like Integer and Double maintain immutability?</strong><br />
      <p><em>Answer:</em> Java wrapper classes like `Integer`, `Double`, and `Boolean` are immutable because their values are set at construction and cannot be changed afterward.</p>
  </li>
  <li> <strong>What are the benefits of using immutable objects in hash-based collections?</strong><br />
      <p><em>Answer:</em> Immutable objects ensure consistent hash codes and equality checks, preventing unexpected behavior when used as keys in hash-based collections like `HashMap`.</p>
  </li>
  <li> <strong>How does immutability affect serialization in Java?</strong><br />
      <p><em>Answer:</em> Immutability makes serialization safer because deserialized objects maintain their original state and cannot be altered after deserialization.</p>
  </li>
  <li> <strong>What is a good strategy for modifying immutable objects?</strong><br />
      <p><em>Answer:</em> Instead of modifying an existing immutable object, you should create and return a new object with the desired changes using a constructor or builder pattern.</p>
  </li>
  <li> <strong>How does immutability improve security in Java applications?</strong><br />
      <p><em>Answer:</em> Immutability prevents malicious code from altering objects unexpectedly, making it a useful practice for securing sensitive data and configurations.</p>
