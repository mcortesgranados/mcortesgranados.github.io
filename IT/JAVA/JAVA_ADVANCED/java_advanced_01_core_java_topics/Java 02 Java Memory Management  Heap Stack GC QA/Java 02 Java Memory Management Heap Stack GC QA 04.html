            <strong>What is a memory leak in Java?</strong><br>
            <p><em>Answer:</em> A memory leak occurs when an application unintentionally retains references to objects that are no longer in use, preventing the garbage collector from reclaiming their memory. This can lead to increased memory usage and eventually cause the application to run out of memory.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>How can you prevent memory leaks in Java?</strong><br>
            <p><em>Answer:</em> To prevent memory leaks:
                <ul>
                    <li>Ensure that unused objects are dereferenced properly.</li>
                    <li>Close resources such as file streams, database connections, and sockets when they are no longer needed.</li>
                    <li>Use weak references where applicable.</li>
                    <li>Use tools like profilers to monitor memory usage.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>What is the purpose of the "finalize()" method in Java?</strong><br>
            <p><em>Answer:</em> The `finalize()` method allows objects to clean up resources before they are garbage collected. It is called by the garbage collector when an object is about to be reclaimed, but it is not guaranteed to be called, and its use is discouraged due to its unpredictability.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>What is the difference between the Heap and the Stack in Java?</strong><br>
            <p><em>Answer:</em> 
                <ul>
                    <li>The Heap is used for dynamic memory allocation of objects and arrays and is shared among all threads in a program.</li>
                    <li>The Stack is used for method call execution, storing local variables and references to objects. Each thread has its own stack.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>What is the role of the Garbage Collector in Java memory management?</strong><br>
            <p><em>Answer:</em> The Garbage Collector (GC) in Java automatically manages memory by identifying and collecting objects that are no longer in use, freeing up memory and preventing memory leaks. It helps in automatic memory management without manual intervention from the developer.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>What is the "young generation" in the context of garbage collection?</strong><br>
            <p><em>Answer:</em> The young generation is the area of the heap where newly created objects are stored. It consists of three parts: Eden space, and two survivor spaces. Objects in the young generation are subject to frequent garbage collection (minor GC), and if they survive multiple collections, they are promoted to the old generation.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>What is the "old generation" in the context of garbage collection?</strong><br>
            <p><em>Answer:</em> The old generation is where long-lived objects are stored after they survive multiple garbage collection cycles in the young generation. Objects in the old generation are less frequently garbage collected, but the collection process (major GC) can lead to longer pause times.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>What is the significance of the Eden space in the young generation?</strong><br>
            <p><em>Answer:</em> The Eden space is where all new objects are initially allocated in the young generation. During minor garbage collection, objects that survive in the Eden space are moved to one of the survivor spaces, and eventually, if they continue to survive, are promoted to the old generation.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>What is the purpose of the "survivor spaces" in garbage collection?</strong><br>
            <p><em>Answer:</em> Survivor spaces are used during minor garbage collection to store objects that survive the GC cycle in the Eden space. There are two survivor spaces: S0 and S1. Objects that are still alive after multiple GC cycles are eventually promoted to the old generation.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>What is the impact of large heap size on garbage collection performance?</strong><br>
            <p><em>Answer:</em> A larger heap size can increase the time it takes for garbage collection, especially in the old generation. However, it can reduce the frequency of garbage collections. It's important to find a balance between heap size and garbage collection performance to avoid long pause times.</p>
