        <li>
            <strong>What is "stack overflow" in Java?</strong><br>
            <p><em>Answer:</em> A stack overflow occurs when a thread’s stack exceeds its allocated memory. This typically happens when a method call exceeds the call stack depth, often due to deep or infinite recursion. The JVM throws a `StackOverflowError` in this case.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>What are "weak references" in Java?</strong><br>
            <p><em>Answer:</em> Weak references in Java are used to reference objects without preventing them from being garbage collected. When an object is only weakly referenced and no strong references exist, it becomes eligible for garbage collection.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>What is the purpose of the "finalize" method in Java?</strong><br>
            <p><em>Answer:</em> The `finalize()` method was used in Java to allow objects to clean up resources (e.g., closing files, releasing memory) before they are garbage collected. However, it is now considered deprecated in favor of more explicit resource management techniques like `try-with-resources`.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>What is the "heap size" in Java, and how can it be controlled?</strong><br>
            <p><em>Answer:</em> The heap size in Java refers to the amount of memory allocated for object storage during program execution. It can be controlled using the `-Xms` option to set the initial size and `-Xmx` to set the maximum size of the heap.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>What is the "young generation" in Java's heap?</strong><br>
            <p><em>Answer:</em> The young generation is a part of the heap where new objects are initially allocated. It consists of the Eden space and survivor spaces. Objects that survive multiple garbage collection cycles in the young generation are promoted to the old generation.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>How does the JVM handle memory leaks caused by circular references?</strong><br>
            <p><em>Answer:</em> The JVM’s garbage collector is capable of detecting and collecting objects with circular references, as long as they are no longer reachable from any live thread or static field. Circular references do not prevent garbage collection in Java.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>What are "soft references" in Java, and when are they used?</strong><br>
            <p><em>Answer:</em> Soft references in Java refer to objects that are eligible for garbage collection only when the JVM needs memory. They are often used for implementing memory-sensitive caches that allow the system to reclaim memory when it is low.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>What is the purpose of the "native memory tracking" (NMT) feature in the JVM?</strong><br>
            <p><em>Answer:</em> Native Memory Tracking (NMT) in the JVM is used to track memory usage outside of the heap (e.g., direct memory, metaspace) to identify memory leaks and optimize memory consumption. It can be enabled using the `-XX:NativeMemoryTracking=summary` option.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>What is "heap fragmentation" in Java?</strong><br>
            <p><em>Answer:</em> Heap fragmentation occurs when free memory in the heap becomes scattered into small, non-contiguous blocks. This can reduce the effectiveness of memory allocation and eventually lead to inefficient memory usage, which may trigger out-of-memory errors.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>What is the role of "garbage collector logs" in Java?</strong><br>
            <p><em>Answer:</em> Garbage collector logs provide detailed information about garbage collection events, such as the duration of each collection, the amount of memory reclaimed, and the type of garbage collection algorithm used. Analyzing these logs helps identify performance bottlenecks related to garbage collection.</p>
