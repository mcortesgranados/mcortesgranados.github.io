        <li>
            <strong>What is "polymorphism" in OOP?</strong><br>
            <p><em>Answer:</em> Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It enables a single method to work on different types of objects, allowing for flexibility in code.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Can you provide an example of polymorphism in Java?</strong><br>
            <pre>
class Animal {
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Animal makes a sound");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Dog barks");
    }
}

class Cat extends Animal {
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Cat meows");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Animal animal1 = new Dog();
        Animal animal2 = new Cat();

        animal1.sound();  // Outputs: Dog barks
        animal2.sound();  // Outputs: Cat meows
    }
}
            </pre>
            <p><em>Answer:</em> Polymorphism allows the `sound` method to work differently depending on the actual object type (either `Dog` or `Cat`) even though it is called on a reference of type `Animal`.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>What is an "abstract class" in Java?</strong><br>
            <p><em>Answer:</em> An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated on its own and is meant to be extended by other classes. It may contain abstract methods (methods without a body) that must be implemented by subclasses.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Can you provide an example of an abstract class in Java?</strong><br>
            <pre>
abstract class Animal {
    abstract void sound();
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Dog barks");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Animal dog = new Dog();
        dog.sound();  // Outputs: Dog barks
    }
}
            </pre>
            <p><em>Answer:</em> The `Animal` class is abstract and contains an abstract method `sound()`, which is implemented by the `Dog` class.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>What is an "interface" in Java?</strong><br>
            <p><em>Answer:</em> An interface is a reference type in Java that can contain only constants, method signatures, default methods, and static methods. It cannot contain instance fields or constructors. A class implements an interface by providing concrete implementations of the methods defined in the interface.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Can you provide an example of an interface in Java?</strong><br>
            <pre>
interface Animal {
    void sound();
}

class Dog implements Animal {
    public void sound() {
        System.out.println("Dog barks");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Animal dog = new Dog();
        dog.sound();  // Outputs: Dog barks
    }
}
            </pre>
            <p><em>Answer:</em> The `Dog` class implements the `Animal` interface and provides a concrete implementation for the `sound` method.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>What is the significance of the `super` keyword in Java?</strong><br>
            <p><em>Answer:</em> The `super` keyword refers to the superclass of the current object. It is used to access superclass methods, constructors, and fields from a subclass.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Can you provide an example of using the `super` keyword in Java?</strong><br>
            <pre>
class Animal {
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Animal makes a sound");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    void sound() {
        super.sound();  // Calls the superclass method
        System.out.println("Dog barks");
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Dog dog = new Dog();
        dog.sound();
        // Outputs:
        // Animal makes a sound
        // Dog barks
    }
}
            </pre>
            <p><em>Answer:</em> The `super.sound()` statement calls the `sound` method from the `Animal` class before executing the `Dog` class's `sound` method.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>What is "composition" in OOP?</strong><br>
            <p><em>Answer:</em> Composition is a design principle where one class is composed of one or more objects of other classes. It represents a "has-a" relationship and is considered a more flexible alternative to inheritance.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Can you provide an example of composition in Java?</strong><br>
            <pre>
class Engine {
    void start() {
        System.out.println("Engine starts");
    }
}

class Car {
    private Engine engine;

    public Car() {
        engine = new Engine();  // Car "has-a" Engine
    }

    void startCar() {
        engine.start();
        System.out.println("Car starts");
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Car car = new Car();
        car.startCar();
        // Outputs:
        // Engine starts
        // Car starts
    }
}
            </pre>
            <p><em>Answer:</em> The `Car` class has an `Engine` object as a member, demonstrating the composition relationship. The `Car` "has-a" `Engine`.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>What is the difference between composition and inheritance in OOP?</strong><br>
            <p><em>Answer:</em> 
            - **Inheritance** represents an "is-a" relationship, where a subclass inherits the behavior of its superclass.
            - **Composition** represents a "has-a" relationship, where a class contains objects of other classes.</p>
