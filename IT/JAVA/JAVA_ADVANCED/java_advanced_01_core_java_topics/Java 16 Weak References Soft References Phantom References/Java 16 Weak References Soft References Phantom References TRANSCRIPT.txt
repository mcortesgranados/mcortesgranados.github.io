What is a Weak Reference in Java?
A WeakReference in Java is a reference type that allows objects to be garbage collected when no strong references exist. It is commonly used for memory-sensitive caches.

What is a Soft Reference in Java?
A SoftReference is similar to a WeakReference, but it is cleared only when the JVM detects low memory. It is useful for caching large objects.

What is a Phantom Reference in Java?
A PhantomReference is a reference that does not prevent garbage collection and is used to perform cleanup actions before the object is removed from memory.

How does a WeakReference differ from a SoftReference?
- A WeakReference is cleared as soon as there are no strong references, while a SoftReference is cleared only when the JVM runs low on memory.
- SoftReferences are useful for implementing caches, whereas WeakReferences are useful for tracking objects without preventing their collection.

Can you manually clear a WeakReference?
Yes, you can manually clear a weak reference using the clear() method.

How do you check if an object has been garbage collected when using PhantomReferences?
You can check if an object has been garbage collected by polling the associated ReferenceQueue.

What is the main purpose of PhantomReferences?
Phantom references are mainly used for pre-mortem cleanup operations, such as finalization mechanisms, before the object is completely removed from memory.

What happens if you try to dereference a PhantomReference?
Calling get() on a PhantomReference always returns null because phantom references are intended only for cleanup tracking, not for accessing objects.

Can a SoftReference prevent an OutOfMemoryError?
No, a SoftReference cannot fully prevent an OutOfMemoryError, but it can delay it by ensuring the object is cleared before the JVM runs out of memory.

Which reference type is best suited for implementing caching mechanisms?
SoftReference is best suited for caching mechanisms because the object is retained until memory pressure forces its removal.

What is the purpose of a ReferenceQueue in Java?
A ReferenceQueue is used to track references that have been cleared by the garbage collector. It allows you to perform post-collection cleanup operations.

Can PhantomReferences be used to access the object they reference?
No, calling get() on a PhantomReference always returns null, as phantom references are solely for tracking object finalization.

What is the difference between SoftReferences and PhantomReferences?

What are the use cases of PhantomReferences?
PhantomReferences are used for tasks such as:
- Pre-mortem cleanup
- Managing off-heap resources
- Monitoring object finalization

Why does calling get() on a SoftReference return the object?
Unlike PhantomReferences, SoftReferences allow retrieval of the object as long as it hasn't been cleared by the garbage collector.

When is it better to use WeakReferences over SoftReferences?
Use WeakReferences when you want objects to be cleared as soon as they are no longer strongly referenced. SoftReferences are better for memory-sensitive caches.

What happens if you don't use a ReferenceQueue with a PhantomReference?
Without a ReferenceQueue, you can't detect when the phantom-referenced object has been collected, which limits the usefulness of PhantomReferences for cleanup operations.
