    <h1>Spark with Hadoop YARN and Resource Managers</h1>

    <p>
        Apache Spark can be integrated with Hadoop YARN (Yet Another Resource Negotiator) for resource management and job scheduling. YARN is a resource management layer in the Hadoop ecosystem that allows multiple applications to share resources dynamically and run concurrently on a Hadoop cluster.
    </p>

    <h2>Introduction to Hadoop YARN</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Resource Management:</strong> YARN manages cluster resources and schedules jobs by allocating resources to applications based on their requirements and availability.</li>
        <li><strong>Job Scheduling:</strong> YARN provides a unified scheduling framework for different types of applications, including batch processing, interactive queries, and real-time processing.</li>
        <li><strong>Components:</strong> YARN consists of ResourceManager (RM), NodeManager (NM), and ApplicationMaster (AM). RM manages resources, NM manages resources on individual nodes, and AM manages application execution.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Integrating Spark with YARN</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Configuration:</strong> To run Spark applications on YARN, configure Spark to use YARN as the cluster manager. This involves setting up Spark's configuration files and specifying YARN-related options.</li>
        <li><strong>Submitting Jobs:</strong> Use the <code>spark-submit</code> command to submit Spark applications to a YARN cluster. This command includes options for specifying YARN-specific settings such as the number of executors and memory allocation.</li>
        <li><strong>Resource Allocation:</strong> YARN dynamically allocates resources based on the requirements of Spark applications and other applications running on the cluster. Spark applications can specify their resource needs in their configuration.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Example Source Code</h2>
    <p>
        Below is an example of how to configure and submit a Spark application to run on a Hadoop YARN cluster.
    </p>

    <h3>Configuration File Example</h3>
    <pre><code class="language-text">
# spark-defaults.conf
spark.master yarn
spark.eventLog.enabled true
spark.eventLog.dir hdfs:///path/to/spark/event/logs
spark.history.fs.logDirectory hdfs:///path/to/spark/history
spark.yarn.jars hdfs:///path/to/spark/jars/*
spark.executor.memory 4g
spark.driver.memory 2g
spark.executor.cores 2
    </code></pre>

    <h3>Submitting a Spark Application</h3>
    <pre><code class="language-bash">
# Submit a Spark job to YARN
spark-submit \
    --class com.example.MySparkApp \
    --master yarn \
    --deploy-mode cluster \
    --executor-memory 4G \
    --total-executor-cores 4 \
    path/to/my-spark-app.jar
    </code></pre>

    <p>
        In this example:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Configuration File:</strong> The <code>spark-defaults.conf</code> file sets Spark to use YARN as the master, enables event logging, and specifies memory and core settings for executors and the driver.</li>
        <li><strong>Submitting a Spark Application:</strong> The <code>spark-submit</code> command submits a Spark job to a YARN cluster. The <code>--master</code> option specifies YARN as the cluster manager, and <code>--deploy-mode</code> is set to <code>cluster</code> for running the driver on the cluster.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Integrating Spark with Hadoop YARN allows for efficient resource management and job scheduling in a distributed environment. By configuring Spark to use YARN and specifying the necessary options, you can effectively run and manage Spark applications on a YARN-managed cluster.
