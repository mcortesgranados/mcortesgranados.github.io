<h2>React Intermediate Questions - Set 12</h2>
<p><b>111. What is code splitting in React?</b><br />
  Code splitting is a technique used to break a large JavaScript bundle into smaller chunks that are loaded dynamically, improving performance and reducing initial load time.</p>
<p><b>112. How does `React.memo` improve performance?</b><br />
  `React.memo` is a higher-order component that prevents unnecessary re-renders by memoizing the rendered output of a component and only updating it when props change.</p>
<p><b>113. What is hydration in React?</b><br />
  Hydration is the process of attaching event listeners and state to server-rendered HTML to make it fully interactive on the client side.</p>
<p><b>114. How does `useReducer` differ from `useState`?</b><br />
  `useReducer` is an alternative to `useState` that is better suited for managing complex state logic involving multiple sub-values and actions, similar to Redux reducers.</p>
<p><b>115. What are controlled and uncontrolled components in React?</b><br />
  Controlled components are form inputs whose value is managed by React state, while uncontrolled components use refs to access input values directly.</p>
<p><b>116. What is suspense in React?</b><br />
  `Suspense` is a component used for handling asynchronous operations like code splitting and data fetching, allowing React to show a fallback UI while waiting.</p>
<p><b>117. How can you measure performance in a React application?</b><br />
  React performance can be measured using the React Developer Tools Profiler, Chrome DevTools, or by manually logging render times with `performance.now()`.</p>
<p><b>118. What is the difference between `props.children` and `React.cloneElement`?</b><br />
  `props.children` allows passing elements as children of a component, while `React.cloneElement` creates a new element with modified props or behavior.</p>
<p><b>119. What are hooks rules in React?</b><br />
  Hooks must only be called at the top level of a function component and not inside loops, conditions, or nested functions. They must also be used in React functional components or custom hooks.</p>
<p><b>120. What is the significance of the `displayName` property in React?</b><br />
  The `displayName` property is used to define a human-readable name for a component in debugging tools like React Developer Tools.</p>
