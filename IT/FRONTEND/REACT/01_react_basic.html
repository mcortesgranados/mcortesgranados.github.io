  React was developed by Facebook (now Meta) and is maintained by both Meta and the open-source community.</p>
<p class="style1"><b>3. What are components in React?</b><br />
  Components are the building blocks of a React application. They are reusable pieces of UI that can be independent and composable.</p>
<p class="style1"><b>4. What is JSX?</b><br />
  JSX (JavaScript XML) is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows writing HTML-like code inside JavaScript files.</p>
<p class="style1"><b>5. What is the difference between functional and class components?</b><br />
  Functional components are simple JavaScript functions, whereas class components are ES6 classes that extend React.Component and can have state.</p>
<p class="style1"><b>6. What is the virtual DOM in React?</b><br />
  The virtual DOM is a lightweight copy of the real DOM that React uses to improve performance by making efficient updates.</p>
<p class="style1"><b>7. Why is React considered declarative?</b><br />
  React is declarative because it allows developers to describe the UI state and let React handle updating the DOM accordingly.</p>
<p class="style1"><b>8. What are props in React?</b><br />
  Props (short for properties) are used to pass data from a parent component to a child component.</p>
<p class="style1"><b>9. What is state in React?</b><br />
  State is an object that holds dynamic data and determines how a component renders and behaves.</p>
<p class="style1"><b>10. How do you create a React application?</b><br />
  A React application can be created using the Create React App (CRA) command-line tool.</p>
