    <h2>React Questions and Answers</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>What is React?</strong>
            <p>React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>What is JSX?</strong>
            <p>JSX (JavaScript XML) is a syntax extension for JavaScript, recommended to use with React to describe what the UI should look like.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>How does React handle component state?</strong>
            <p>React components have a state object, and when the state changes, the component re-renders.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>What is the virtual DOM?</strong>
            <p>The virtual DOM is a lightweight copy of the real DOM. React uses it to improve performance by minimizing direct manipulation of the actual DOM.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>What is a React component?</strong>
            <p>A React component is a reusable, self-contained module that renders a portion of the UI.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>What is the significance of <code>props</code> in React?</strong>
            <p><code>props</code> (short for properties) are used to pass data from a parent component to a child component.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Explain the concept of lifting state up in React.</strong>
            <p>Lifting state up means moving the state to a higher-level component, allowing multiple child components to share the same state.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>What are the lifecycle methods in React?</strong>
            <p>Lifecycle methods include <code>componentDidMount</code>, <code>componentDidUpdate</code>, and <code>componentWillUnmount</code>, among others.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Explain the purpose of <code>componentDidMount</code>.</strong>
            <p><code>componentDidMount</code> is invoked immediately after a component is mounted. It is suitable for actions that require the DOM to be fully constructed.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>How does React handle event handling?</strong>
            <p>React uses synthetic events to normalize browser-specific events, making it consistent across different browsers.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>What is the significance of <code>shouldComponentUpdate</code>?</strong>
            <p><code>shouldComponentUpdate</code> is used to let React know if a component's output is affected by the current change in state or props, and whether it should re-render.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>What is the difference between state and props?</strong>
            <p>State is internal and controlled by the component, while props are external and passed to the component.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>What is React Context API?</strong>
            <p>Context provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props manually at every level.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Explain the concept of controlled components.</strong>
            <p>In a controlled component, the form data is handled by the React component's state.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>What is the purpose of Redux in React applications?</strong>
            <p>Redux is a state management library for JavaScript applications, especially useful for managing the state of larger applications.</p>

        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>How does the <code>useEffect</code> hook work?</strong>
            <p><code>useEffect</code> is used to perform side effects in functional components, such as data fetching, subscriptions, or manually changing the DOM.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>What is React Router?</strong>
            <p>React Router is a standard library for routing in React applications.</p>

        <li>
            <strong>What is a Higher-Order Component (HOC) in React?</strong>
            <p>A Higher-Order Component is a function that takes a component and returns a new component with additional props or behavior.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Why might you use a HOC?</strong>
            <p>HOCs are used for code reuse, abstraction of state or behavior, and adding additional functionality to components.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>How can you handle errors in React?</strong>
            <p>You can use error boundaries (using <code>componentDidCatch</code> lifecycle method) to catch JavaScript errors.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Explain React Router's <code>withRouter</code> HOC.</strong>
            <p><code>withRouter</code> is a higher-order component provided by React Router that wraps a component and gives it access to the router's props.</p>

        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>What are keys in React and why are they important?</strong>
            <p>Keys are used to give each element in a list a stable identity, helping React identify which items have changed, been added, or been removed.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Why is it a good practice to avoid using indexes as keys in lists?</strong>
            <p>Using indexes as keys can lead to issues when reordering or modifying the list. React may not correctly identify which item has changed.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>What are the benefits of using PureComponent?</strong>
            <p>PureComponent performs a shallow comparison of state and props, avoiding unnecessary renders when they haven't changed.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>How can you optimize performance in React functional components?</strong>
            <p>Use React.memo, useCallback, and useMemo to memoize components, functions, and values to avoid unnecessary re-renders.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>What is TypeScript, and how can it be integrated with React?</strong>
            <p>TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing. It can be integrated into React projects to provide better tooling and type safety.</p>

        <li>
            <strong>How do you define propTypes in a TypeScript React component?</strong>
            <p>With TypeScript, PropTypes are not needed, as TypeScript provides static type checking.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Besides Redux, what are some other state management libraries for React?</strong>
            <p>MobX, Recoil, and Zustand are some alternative state management libraries.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>What is server-side rendering in React?</strong>
            <p>Server-side rendering involves rendering React components on the server side and sending the fully rendered page to the client.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>How can you implement server-side rendering in a React application?</strong>
