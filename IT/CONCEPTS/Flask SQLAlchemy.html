    <h1>Flask SQLAlchemy</h1>

    <p>
        Flask SQLAlchemy is an extension for Flask, a popular Python web framework, that adds support for SQLAlchemy, an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library. With Flask SQLAlchemy, you can easily integrate a relational database into your Flask application and interact with it using Python objects.
    </p>

    <h2>Key Features:</h2>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Object-Relational Mapping (ORM):</strong> Flask SQLAlchemy allows you to define database models as Python classes. These classes represent tables in your database, and instances of these classes correspond to rows in the tables.</li>
        <li><strong>Database Sessions:</strong> Flask SQLAlchemy provides a session interface for handling database transactions. Sessions help manage the lifecycle of interactions with the database.</li>
        <li><strong>Querying:</strong> You can use SQLAlchemy's powerful querying capabilities to retrieve, filter, and manipulate data in the database using a Pythonic syntax.</li>
        <li><strong>Migrations:</strong> Flask SQLAlchemy integrates with Alembic for database migrations. Migrations help manage changes to your database schema over time as your application evolves.</li>
        <li><strong>Integration with Flask:</strong> Flask SQLAlchemy is designed to work seamlessly with Flask. It integrates with Flask's application and request context, making it easy to use within your Flask routes and views.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Usage:</h2>

    <p>
        Flask SQLAlchemy is commonly used for building web applications where a relational database is needed to store and retrieve data. It is suitable for a wide range of applications, from small projects to large-scale applications requiring complex data models and relationships.
