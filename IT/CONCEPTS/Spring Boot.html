            <p>Spring Boot is an open-source framework that simplifies the development of Java-based applications. It provides a set of conventions and defaults for common tasks, allowing developers to focus more on business logic rather than boilerplate code.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <h3>Explain the key features of Spring Boot.</h3>
            <p>Spring Boot offers features such as auto-configuration, standalone development, opinionated defaults, and a variety of production-ready plugins. It also simplifies dependency management and provides a built-in development server.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <h3>What is Spring Boot Auto-Configuration?</h3>
            <p>Auto-configuration in Spring Boot automatically configures the application based on its dependencies. It eliminates the need for explicit configuration files by guessing and providing sensible defaults. Developers can override these defaults as needed.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <h3>Explain the concept of Spring Boot Starters.</h3>
            <p>Spring Boot Starters are a set of convenient dependency descriptors that you can include in your application. They simplify the management of dependencies by bundling commonly used libraries and configurations, making it easy to get started with specific technologies.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <h3>What is the purpose of the @SpringBootApplication annotation?</h3>
            <p>The <code>@SpringBootApplication</code> annotation in Spring Boot is a convenience annotation that combines <code>@Configuration</code>, <code>@EnableAutoConfiguration</code>, and <code>@ComponentScan</code>. It is typically placed on the main class to enable the auto-configuration and component scanning features.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <h3>Explain the difference between @RestController and @Controller.</h3>
            <p><code>@RestController</code> is a specialized version of <code>@Controller</code> in Spring MVC that is used to create RESTful web services. It is a shorthand for <code>@Controller</code> and <code>@ResponseBody</code>, indicating that the return values of methods should be directly serialized to the HTTP response body.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <h3>What is Spring Boot Actuator?</h3>
            <p>Spring Boot Actuator is a set of production-ready features that help you monitor and manage your application.

Spring Boot also supports various databases and provides default configurations for commonly used data sources.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <h3>Explain the role of the application.properties (or application.yml) file in Spring Boot.</h3>
            <p>The <code>application.properties</code> or <code>application.yml</code> file in Spring Boot is used for externalized configuration. It allows developers to specify configuration properties such as database connection details, server ports, and other settings outside the application code. Spring Boot automatically picks up these properties during application startup.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <h3>What is the purpose of the Spring Boot CommandLineRunner interface?</h3>
            <p>The <code>CommandLineRunner</code> interface in Spring Boot is used to run code after the application context has been loaded and just before the application starts. It is typically used for tasks that need to be executed once the application is up and running, such as data initialization or system checks.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <h3>How does Spring Boot handle exception handling in RESTful services?</h3>
            <p>Spring Boot provides robust support for handling exceptions in RESTful services. By using the <code>@ExceptionHandler</code> annotation and implementing a global exception handler, developers can centralize the handling of exceptions and provide consistent error responses across the application.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <h3>Explain the concept of Spring Boot Profiles.</h3>
            <p>Spring Boot Profiles allow developers to define sets of configuration properties that can be activated based on the environment or application requirements. By using profiles, you can customize the behavior of your application for different environments, such as development, testing, and production.</p>

        </li>

        <li>
            <h3>How does Spring Boot handle logging?</h3>
            <p>Spring Boot uses the SLF4J (Simple Logging Facade for Java) as a logging facade, allowing developers to use various logging implementations such as Logback or Log4j. By default, Spring Boot includes sensible default logging configurations, and you can customize them using properties in the application.properties or application.yml file.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <h3>Explain the purpose of Spring Boot Data JPA.</h3>
            <p>Spring Boot Data JPA simplifies database access using the Java Persistence API (JPA). It provides a set of abstractions and conventions for data access, reducing the amount of boilerplate code required for common database operations. With Spring Boot Data JPA, developers can work with databases using high-level repository interfaces.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <h3>What is the significance of the @SpringBootTest annotation?</h3>
            <p>The <code>@SpringBootTest</code> annotation is used to specify that a class is a Spring Boot integration test. It loads the entire Spring application context, allowing developers to test the application in a way that is closer to how it runs in a production environment. This annotation is often used in combination with other testing annotations like <code>@RunWith(SpringRunner.class)</code>.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <h3>How does Spring Boot support caching?</h3>
            <p>Spring Boot provides caching support through the use of the <code>@Cacheable</code>, <code>@CacheEvict</code>, and other caching annotations. By annotating methods with these annotations, developers can enable caching for specific methods, improving performance by storing and retrieving results from a cache instead of re-executing the method.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <h3>Explain the role of the Spring Boot Banner.</h3>
            <p>The Spring Boot Banner is a feature that displays an ASCII art representation of the Spring Boot logo and application information during the application startup. It provides a visually appealing and recognizable output in the console, and you can customize the banner by providing your ASCII art or by disabling it in the application properties.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <h3>What is the purpose of the @Scheduled annotation in Spring Boot?</h3>
            <p>The <code>@Scheduled</code> annotation is used to trigger periodic tasks in a Spring Boot application. By annotating a method with <code>@Scheduled</code>, developers can define a fixed-rate or fixed-delay schedule for the execution of the method. This is commonly used for background tasks, job scheduling, and other time-based operations.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <h3>How can you enable cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) in a Spring Boot application?</h3>
            <p>CORS support in Spring Boot can be enabled by using the <code>@CrossOrigin</code> annotation on controllers or by configuring CORS globally using the <code>WebMvcConfigurer</code> interface. This allows you to define which origins are allowed to access your RESTful APIs, helping to secure your application against cross-origin requests.</p>

    <p>Which one of the following is not a 'terminal' operation on a Stream in Java 1) limit 2) forEach 3) count 4) collect</p>
    <p>In Java Streams, terminal operations are operations that produce a result or a side-effect. Among the options you provided:</p>
    <p>limit - This is an intermediate operation that restricts the number of elements in the stream. It doesn't produce a final result.</p>
    <p>forEach - This is a terminal operation that performs an action for each element in the stream.</p>
    <p>count - This is a terminal operation that returns the count of elements in the stream as a long.</p>
    <p>collect - This is a terminal operation that transforms the elements of the stream into a different form, usually a collection like a List, Set, or Map.</p>

    <p>which of the following statements are true of the Java String class 1) The substring(0 method returns a new String object 2) A String object is inmutable 3) The toUpperCase() method modifies the String object 4) The String class inherits from the Text class<br>
    </p>
    <p>Let's go through each statement:</p>
    <p>The substring(0) method returns a new String object:</p>
    <p>This statement is generally true. The substring method in Java returns a new string that is a substring of the original string.<br>
      A String object is immutable:</p>
    <p>This statement is true. In Java, the String class is immutable, meaning once a String object is created, its value cannot be changed.<br>
      The toUpperCase() method modifies the String object:</p>
    <p>This statement is not true. The toUpperCase() method returns a new String object with all the characters converted to uppercase. It does not modify the original String object.<br>
      The String class inherits from the Text class:</p>
    <p>This statement is not true. In Java, the String class is a final class and does not inherit from any other class. It directly extends the Object class.<br>
      So, the true statements are:</p>
    <p>Statement 1: The substring(0) method returns a new String object.<br>
      Statement 2: A String object is immutable.</p>

      name -&gt; System.out.println(name) b) <br>
      System.out.println(_) c) <br>
      The Lambda is already in it's most concise form. d) <br>
      (String) -&gt; System.out.println(String)</p>
    <p>The more concise version of the Lambda expression in the given code is:</p>

    <p>The correct option that will compile after the given code has executed is:</p>
    <p>ii. processor.processPurchaseOrders(poArray);</p>
    <p>Explanation:</p>
    <p>The processPurchaseOrders method in the Processor class is designed to accept varargs of type PurchaseOrder. The code provided initializes an array poArray of PurchaseOrder objects.</p>
    <p>Options i, iii, iv, and v involve passing individual PurchaseOrder objects as arguments. However, option ii directly passes the array of PurchaseOrder objects, which matches the varargs parameter of the method, and it will compile successfully.</p>
    <p>Previous have two or more valid options<br>
    </p>
    <p>___________________________________________________________________________________________________________<br>
    </p>
    <p>I apologize for any confusion in my previous response. Let's reevaluate the options:</p>
    <p>i. processor.processPurchaseOrders(poArray, po1); - This would not compile because the method expects varargs, and you're passing both an array and an individual PurchaseOrder object.</p>
    <p>ii. processor.processPurchaseOrders(poArray); - This would compile, as it matches the varargs parameter by directly passing the array.</p>
    <p>iii. processor.processPurchaseOrders(po1, poArray); - This would not compile because the array should be the last parameter when using varargs.</p>
    <p>iv. processor.processPurchaseOrders(po1, po2); - This would not compile because the method expects varargs, and you're passing two individual PurchaseOrder objects.</p>
    <p>v. processor.processPurchaseOrders(po1); - This would compile, as it matches the varargs parameter by passing a single PurchaseOrder object.</p>
    <p>So, the correct options are ii and v. I appreciate your patience and understanding.</p>

    <p>A Document class is defined below.</p>
    <p>public class Document {</p>
    <p> public void save(){<br>
      updateTimeStamp();<br>

      notifyCollaberators();<br>
      }</p>
    <p> //Other methods<br>

    </p>
    <p>A BackedUpDocument class is being written.</p>
    <p>public class BackedUpDocument extends Document{<br>
    </p>
    <p>Which of the following methods correctly overrides the save method? a)    @Override<br>
      public void save() {<br>
      super.save();<br>
      this.backup();<br>
      } b)  @Override<br>
      public void save() {<br>
      save();<br>
      this.backup();<br>

      } d)   @Override<br>
      public void save(DocumentContents contents) {<br>
      super.save();<br>
      this.backup(contents);<br>
      }<br>
  <br>
      The correct method that correctly overrides the save method in the BackedUpDocument class is:</p>
    <p>a)</p>
    <p>java<br>
      Copy code<br>
      @Override<br>
      public void save() {<br>
      super.save();<br>
      this.backup();<br>
      }<br>
      Explanation:</p>
    <p>In option a, the method correctly uses @Override, calls super.save() to invoke the parent class's save method, and then performs the backup operation specific to the BackedUpDocument class.<br>
      Options b, c, and d are incorrect:</p>
    <p>Option b calls save() recursively instead of calling the parent class's save method.</p>
    <p>Option c incorrectly uses super() which is not valid for calling a method, and it doesn't call the parent class's save method.</p>
    <p>Option d introduces a new parameter (DocumentContents contents) which is not present in the overridden method in the parent class. Also, it doesn't call the parent class's save method using super.save().<br>

      What is required for a class to implement the Externalizable interface? a) <br>
      The class must implement the readObject and writeObject methods b) <br>
      Nothing, the Externalizable interface is a marker interface. The compiler adds the required functionality c) <br>
      The class must implement the readExternal and writeExternal methods d) <br>
      The class must also implement the Serializable interface</p>
    <p>c) The class must implement the readExternal and writeExternal methods</p>
    <p>Explanation:</p>
    <p>For a class to implement the Externalizable interface in Java, it must provide its own implementations for the readExternal and writeExternal methods. Unlike the Serializable interface, which is a marker interface, the Externalizable interface requires explicit implementations for serialization and deserialization operations.</p>
    <p>So, the correct option is (c).</p>

    <p>What method call on the names list will sort `names` in alphabetical order in Java?</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>List names = Arrays.asList(&quot;Bob&quot;, &quot;Bill&quot;, &quot;Ben&quot;);<br>
      // What goes here?<br>
      System.out.println(names); a) <br>
      names.orderBy((a) -&gt; (a.toString())) b) <br>
      names.sort((a, b) -&gt; (a.compareTo(b))); c) <br>
      names.sort(a.compareTo(b)) d) <br>
      There is no sort operation on Lists, use `Collections.sort`<br>
    </p>
    <p>The correct option for sorting the names list in alphabetical order is:</p>
    <p>b)</p>
    <p>java<br>
      Copy code<br>
      names.sort((a, b) -&gt; (a.compareTo(b)));<br>
      Explanation:</p>
    <p>In Java, the List interface has a sort method that can be used to sort the elements of the list. The provided lambda expression (a, b) -&gt; (a.compareTo(b)) specifies the natural order for sorting strings in alphabetical order.<br>

    <p>What is NOT a core advantage of using Streams over Collections? a) <br>
      They are declarative, your code can be closer to the business logic in hand. b) <br>
      They are parallelizable, operations on streams can be carried out on multiple cores without the need for lock, synchronized blocks etc. c) <br>
      They are imperative, operations on the items in the stream are carried out in a known order that must be declared up front. d) <br>
      They are composable, operations on streams can be combined to perform complex logic simply<br>
    </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>c) They are imperative, operations on the items in the stream are carried out in a known order that must be declared upfront.</p>
    <p>Explanation:</p>
    <p>The statement in option c is not accurate. Streams are declarative, not imperative. Operations on streams describe what you want to achieve rather than detailing how to achieve it. The order of execution for operations on a stream is determined by the underlying implementation and can be optimized for parallelism. In contrast, imperative programming often involves specifying the exact sequence of steps to achieve a result.<br>

      You have the following java code. How do you complete it so that `number` is either the Room's number or a default value of 42?</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>class Course <br>
      {<br>
      public Course()<br>
      {<br>
      }<br>

      }</p>
    <p>class Room <br>

      Integer number;<br>
      Optional getNumber()<br>
      {<br>

      } </p>
    <p>....</p>
    <p>Course c = new Course();<br>
      Integer number = //what goes here? a) java c.getRoom().getNumber().orElseGet(42); b) <br>
      java c.getRoom().map(Room.getNumber()).orElse(42); c) java c.getRoom().flatMap(Room::getNumber).orElse(42); d) java c.getRoom().map(Room::getNumber).orElse(42);</p>
    <p>The correct option to complete the code so that number is either the Room's number or a default value of 42 is:</p>
    <p>c)</p>
    <p>java<br>
      Copy code<br>
      Integer number = c.getRoom().flatMap(Room::getNumber).orElse(42);<br>
      Explanation:</p>
    <p>getRoom() returns an Optional of Room.<br>
      flatMap(Room::getNumber) transforms the Optional&lt;Room&gt; to Optional&lt;Integer&gt;.<br>
      orElse(42) provides a default value of 42 if the Optional is empty.</p>

    <p>Given the bean definition below what is the sequence of actions the Spring framework does while instantiating this bean?</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&lt;bean id=&quot;service&quot; class=&quot;a.b.c.ServiceImpl&quot; init-method=&quot;init&quot;&gt;<br>
  &lt;property name=&quot;property&quot; value=&quot;value&quot;/&gt;<br>
  &lt;/bean&gt; a) Creates ServiceImpl, calls ServiceImpl .init(), calls ServiceImpl.setProperty(“value”) a) Creates ServiceImpl, calls ServiceImpl .init(), calls ServiceImpl.setProperty(“value”) b) <br>
      Creates ServiceImpl, calls ServiceImpl.setProperty(“value”), ServiceImpl .init() is called when the bean is first used c) <br>
      Creates ServiceImpl, calls ServiceImpl.setProperty(“value”), calls ServiceImpl .init() d) <br>
      Calls ServiceImpl .init(), creates ServiceImpl, calls ServiceImpl.setProperty(“value”)</p>
    <p>The correct sequence of actions performed by the Spring framework while instantiating this bean is:</p>
    <p>a) Creates ServiceImpl, calls ServiceImpl.init(), calls ServiceImpl.setProperty(&quot;value&quot;)</p>
    <p>Explanation:</p>
    <p>The Spring container creates an instance of ServiceImpl.<br>
      It sets the property &quot;property&quot; with the value &quot;value&quot; using setProperty(&quot;value&quot;).<br>
      It calls the init method specified in the init-method attribute using init().<br>
      So, the correct option is:</p>
    <p>a) Creates ServiceImpl, calls ServiceImpl.init(), calls ServiceImpl.setProperty(&quot;value&quot;)</p>

      String message = &quot;Welcome&quot;;<br>
      list.forEach( name -&gt; System.out.println(message + &quot; &quot; + name) );<br>
      message = &quot;Goodbye&quot;; a) Yes, the code will compile, Lambdas may &quot;close over&quot; variables b) <br>
      No, the signature of the Lambda is incomplete c) <br>
      No, foreach does not accept a Lambda d) <br>
      No, variables in Lambdas must be final or effectively final<br>
    </p>
    <p>The code will compile successfully. The correct option is:</p>
    <p>a) Yes, the code will compile, Lambdas may &quot;close over&quot; variables</p>
    <p>Explanation:</p>
    <p>In Java, lambdas can access local variables (including parameters) from the enclosing scope as long as those variables are effectively final or are effectively treated as final. In this case, the message variable is effectively final because it is not reassigned after being initialized. The lambda expression captures and closes over the message variable.</p>
    <p>___________________________________________________________________________________________________________</p>
    <p>Consider the following code:</p>
    <p>java public static void main(String [] args) {<br>

      }</p>
    <p>public static void doWork(Runnable r) {<br>

    <p>What can we infer about the Runnable interface?</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>i. It is annotated with @FunctionalInterface</p>
    <p>ii. It was not available prior to Java 8</p>
    <p>iii. It contains only one method definition</p>
    <p>iv. It contains a `default` method</p>
    <p>a) <br>
      i, ii, iii and iv b) <br>
      i and iii c) <br>
      i, ii, and iii d) <br>
      ii and iii<br>
    </p>
    <p>The correct inference about the Runnable interface is:</p>
    <p>b) i and iii</p>
    <p>Explanation:</p>
    <p>i. @FunctionalInterface: The Runnable interface is annotated with @FunctionalInterface, indicating that it is intended to be a functional interface with a single abstract method (run).</p>
    <p>ii. &quot;It was not available prior to Java 8&quot;: This is incorrect. The Runnable interface has been available in Java prior to Java 8.</p>
    <p>iii. &quot;It contains only one method definition&quot;: This is correct. The Runnable interface has only one abstract method, which is run.</p>
    <p>iv. &quot;It contains a default method&quot;: This is incorrect. The Runnable interface does not contain any default methods.</p>
    <p>So, the correct answer is:</p>
    <p>b) i and iii<br>

      Explanation:</p>
    <p>The Class.forName(classname) is used to obtain the Class object.<br>

    <p>Write a function to return the compressed version of any string using the Run-length algorithm. This algorithm takes any repeating character and outputs a the number of occurances before the first character of that sequence.</p>
    <p>For example: “aaabbcdddd” would result in “3a2bc4d”</p>
    <p>Certainly! Here's a simple Java function that implements the Run-length algorithm for compressing a string:</p>
    <p>java<br>

      System.out.println(&quot;Compressed: &quot; + compressed);<br>
      }<br>
      }<br>
      This compress function iterates through the input string, counts consecutive occurrences of a character, and appends the count followed by the character to the compressed string when the sequence changes. The final compressed string is then returned.</p>
