    <h1>ASP.NET Web API Overview</h1>

    <p>ASP.NET Web API is a framework for building HTTP services that can be consumed by a wide range of clients, including browsers and mobile devices. It is designed to make it easy to build RESTful services using the principles of HTTP. Let's explore the key aspects of the architecture of ASP.NET Web API:</p>

    <h2>Architecture Overview</h2>

    <p><strong>1. Controllers:</strong> Controllers in ASP.NET Web API are similar to controllers in ASP.NET MVC and are responsible for handling incoming HTTP requests. Each controller class typically represents a resource or a group of related resources, and actions within the controller handle various HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).</p>

    <p><strong>2. Routing:</strong> ASP.NET Web API uses a routing mechanism to map incoming HTTP requests to the appropriate controller and action. The routing configuration defines how URLs should be structured and how they map to specific actions in the controllers.</p>

    <p><strong>3. Model Binding:</strong> Model Binding in ASP.NET Web API involves the automatic conversion of incoming request data (such as JSON or XML) into strongly-typed objects that can be used by the action methods. Model binding simplifies the process of working with data in the request payload.</p>

    <p><strong>4. Formatters:</strong> Formatters in ASP.NET Web API are responsible for serializing and deserializing data between the server and clients. The framework supports various formatters for different content types, including JSON and XML. Developers can also create custom formatters.</p>

    <p><strong>5. Filters:</strong> Filters provide a way to implement cross-cutting concerns in ASP.NET Web API. They can be applied globally to all controllers or specific to individual actions. Common filters include authentication, authorization, logging, and exception handling.</p>

    <p><strong>6. Content Negotiation:</strong> Content negotiation in ASP.NET Web API allows clients to specify the desired content type (JSON, XML, etc.) for the response. The framework automatically selects the appropriate formatter based on the client's preference or the request headers.</p>

    <p><strong>7. Dependency Injection:</strong> ASP.NET Web API supports dependency injection, allowing developers to inject services and dependencies into controllers and other components. This promotes modularity and testability by making it easier to manage and replace dependencies.</p>

        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>What is the purpose of IHttpActionResult in ASP.NET Web API?</strong>
            <p>IHttpActionResult in ASP.NET Web API is an interface representing the result of an HTTP operation. It allows for more control over the HTTP response, enabling developers to return different types of results, such as Ok, NotFound, or BadRequest.</p>
        </li>

            <strong>Explain the concept of Model Validation in ASP.NET Web API.</strong>
            <p>Model Validation in ASP.NET Web API ensures that the data received in the request is valid before processing it in the action method. It can be performed using data annotations, custom validation attributes, or a validation filter.</p>
        </li>

        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Explain the concept of IHttpActionResult vs. HttpResponseMessage in ASP.NET Web API.</strong>
            <p>IHttpActionResult and HttpResponseMessage in ASP.NET Web API both represent the result of an HTTP operation. IHttpActionResult provides a higher-level and more testable abstraction, while HttpResponseMessage offers more control over the response details.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>How does ASP.NET Web API handle exceptions?</strong>
            <p>ASP.NET Web API provides a global exception handler to catch unhandled exceptions.
