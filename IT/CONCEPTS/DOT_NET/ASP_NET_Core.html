    <h1>ASP.NET Core Overview</h1>

    <h2>Architecture Overview</h2>

    <p><strong>1. Cross-Platform:</strong> ASP.NET Core is designed to be cross-platform, allowing developers to build and run applications on Windows, Linux, and macOS. This is achieved through the use of the .NET Core runtime, which is lightweight and supports a variety of operating systems.</p>

    <p><strong>2. Modular and Extensible:</strong> ASP.NET Core follows a modular architecture, where the framework is organized into individual and lightweight components. Developers can choose and include only the components needed for their application, reducing the overall footprint and improving performance.</p>

    <p><strong>3. Middleware:</strong> Middleware components form the core of the ASP.NET Core request processing pipeline. Each middleware component is responsible for handling specific tasks, such as authentication, routing, and error handling. Developers can customize the pipeline by adding, removing, or reordering middleware components.</p>

    <p><strong>4. Dependency Injection:</strong> ASP.NET Core has built-in support for Dependency Injection (DI). DI is used to manage the dependencies between different components of an application, promoting a loosely coupled and testable architecture. Services, including those provided by the framework and custom services, can be easily injected into components.</p>

    <p><strong>5. Cross-Cutting Concerns:</strong> ASP.NET Core emphasizes the use of cross-cutting concerns, such as logging, caching, and security, through middleware components and services. This approach allows developers to encapsulate and manage these concerns independently, improving code maintainability.</p>

    <p><strong>6. Unified MVC Framework:</strong> ASP.NET Core includes a unified MVC framework that combines the best features of Web API and MVC (Model-View-Controller). This framework enables the development of both web applications and APIs using a consistent and cohesive programming model.</p>

    <p><strong>7. Hosting:</strong> ASP.NET Core applications can be hosted using different web servers. The default server is Kestrel, a cross-platform web server optimized for performance. Additionally, ASP.NET Core applications can be hosted behind reverse proxy servers like Nginx or Apache.</p>
