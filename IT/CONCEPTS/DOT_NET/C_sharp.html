    <h2>C# Programming Language Overview:</h2>

    <p>C# (pronounced "C sharp") is a modern, object-oriented programming language developed by Microsoft. It is part of the .NET framework and is widely used for building Windows applications, web applications, cloud services, and more. C# is known for its simplicity, type safety, and scalability, making it a versatile language for various software development scenarios.</p>

    <h3>Key Features of C#:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Object-Oriented:</strong> C# supports the principles of object-oriented programming (OOP), such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.</li>
        <li><strong>Type Safety:</strong> C# is a statically-typed language, which means that the type of a variable is known at compile time, reducing the chances of runtime errors.</li>
        <li><strong>Memory Management:</strong> C# includes automatic memory management through a garbage collector, simplifying memory allocation and deallocation.</li>
        <li><strong>.NET Framework Integration:</strong> C# is tightly integrated with the .NET framework, providing access to a wide range of libraries and tools for application development.</li>
        <li><strong>Language Interoperability:</strong> C# can interoperate with other languages that target the Common Language Runtime (CLR), enabling integration with existing codebases.</li>
        <li><strong>Exception Handling:</strong> C# supports robust exception handling to manage errors and unexpected events in a structured way.</li>
        <li><strong>LINQ (Language-Integrated Query):</strong> LINQ allows developers to write queries directly in C# for querying data from various sources, such as databases and collections.</li>
        <li><strong>Asynchronous Programming:</strong> C# provides asynchronous programming features, such as async/await, to simplify the development of scalable and responsive applications.</li>
        <li><strong>Delegates and Events:</strong> C# supports delegates, allowing the creation of type-safe function pointers, and events for implementing the observer pattern.</li>
        <li><strong>Properties and Indexers:</strong> C# provides a convenient way to encapsulate fields through properties and indexers, promoting good coding practices.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>20 Technical Interview Questions and Answers:</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>
            <p><strong>What is C# and what are its key features?</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Answer:</strong> C# is an object-oriented programming language developed by Microsoft. Key features include OOP support, type safety, automatic memory management, .NET framework integration, and language interoperability.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Explain the difference between value types and reference types in C#.</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Value types store their data directly, while reference types store a reference to the data. Value types are stored on the stack, and reference types are stored on the heap.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>What is the purpose of the 'using' statement in C#?</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Answer:</strong> The 'using' statement is used for resource management, ensuring that IDisposable objects are properly disposed of after use.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Describe the differences between 'abstract' and 'interface' in C#.</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Answer:</strong> An abstract class can have abstract and non-abstract members, while an interface only contains abstract members. A class can inherit from only one abstract class, but it can implement multiple interfaces.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>What is the role of the 'async' and 'await' keywords in C#?</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Answer:</strong> 'async' is used to define an asynchronous method, and 'await' is used to asynchronously wait for a task to complete without blocking the calling thread.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Explain the purpose of the garbage collector in C#.</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Answer:</strong> The garbage collector automatically manages memory by reclaiming unused objects, preventing memory leaks and simplifying memory management.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>How does exception handling work in C#?</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Exception handling in C# is done using try, catch, and finally blocks. Exceptions are thrown using the 'throw' keyword and caught using catch blocks.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>What is the role of delegates in C#?</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Delegates are type-safe function pointers used to define and encapsulate methods, enabling callback mechanisms and event handling.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Explain the concept of polymorphism in C#.</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Polymorphism allows objects of different types to be treated as objects of a common base type, enabling code reuse and flexibility.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>What is LINQ, and how is it used in C#?</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Answer:</strong> LINQ (Language-Integrated Query) allows writing queries directly in C# to query data from various sources like databases and collections, providing a unified querying syntax.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Differentiate between 'readonly' and 'const' in C#?</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Answer:</strong> 'const' is compile-time constant, and 'readonly' is runtime constant. 'const' is implicitly static, while 'readonly' can be instance-specific.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Explain the 'yield' keyword in C#.</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Answer:</strong> 'yield' is used in iterator methods to pause execution and return control to the caller, allowing the method to produce a sequence of values lazily.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>What are indexers in C#?</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Indexers allow objects to be indexed like arrays, enabling custom types to provide array-like access to their elements.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>How does the 'using' statement work with IDisposable objects?</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Answer:</strong> The 'using' statement ensures that the Dispose method of IDisposable objects is called when leaving the scope, facilitating proper resource cleanup.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>What is the purpose of the 'lock' statement in C#?</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Answer:</strong> The 'lock' statement is used to synchronize access to a shared resource in a multithreaded environment, preventing multiple threads from accessing the resource simultaneously.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>How does dependency injection work in C#?</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Dependency injection is a design pattern where dependencies are injected into a class rather than created internally. It promotes loose coupling and testability.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Explain the concept of boxing and unboxing in C#.</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Boxing is the process of converting a value type to a reference type, and unboxing is the process of converting a boxed value type back to its original value type.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>What is the purpose of the 'params' keyword in C#?</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Answer:</strong> The 'params' keyword allows a method to accept a variable number of parameters, simplifying method calls with varying argument counts.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>How can you implement a Singleton pattern in C#?</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Answer:</strong> A common way is to use a private static instance and a private constructor to ensure only one instance is created and provide a public static method to access it.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Explain the differences between 'StringBuilder' and 'String' in C#.</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Answer:</strong> 'StringBuilder' is mutable and designed for efficient string manipulation, while 'String' is immutable and any modification results in a new string instance. 'StringBuilder' is more efficient for concatenating multiple strings.</p>
        </li>
    </ol>
