<h1>Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS)</h1>

  <p>The Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) is a distributed file storage system designed to provide scalable and reliable storage for large-scale data processing in Apache Hadoop clusters. It is a fundamental component of Hadoop and offers several key features:</p>

  <h2>1. Distributed Storage:</h2>
  <p>HDFS stores data across multiple nodes in a Hadoop cluster, enabling parallel processing of large datasets. It breaks large files into blocks, typically 128 MB or 256 MB in size, and distributes them across the cluster.</p>

  <h2>2. Fault Tolerance:</h2>
  <p>HDFS is designed for fault tolerance. It replicates each data block multiple times (by default, three times) across different nodes in the cluster. If a node or data block becomes unavailable, HDFS can retrieve the data from its replicated copies.</p>

  <h2>3. Scalability:</h2>
  <p>HDFS scales horizontally, allowing organizations to add more nodes to the cluster as data volumes grow. This scalability is crucial for handling the storage needs of large-scale data processing applications.</p>

  <h2>4. Block-Based Storage:</h2>
  <p>HDFS stores data in blocks, and each block is replicated for fault tolerance. The block size is configurable, and larger block sizes are often used for large files to optimize storage and processing efficiency.</p>

  <h2>5. Write-Once, Read-Many (WORM):</h2>
  <p>Data in HDFS is typically written once and read many times. This model aligns with the requirements of many big data processing workloads, such as batch processing and analytics.</p>

  <h2>6. Namenode and Datanode Architecture:</h2>
  <p>HDFS follows a master-slave architecture. The Namenode is the master server that manages metadata and namespace operations, while Datanodes are responsible for storing and managing the actual data blocks.</p>

  <h2>7. Data Replication:</h2>
  <p>HDFS replicates data blocks across Datanodes for fault tolerance. The replication factor is configurable, and administrators can set the desired level of redundancy based on the cluster's requirements.</p>

  <h2>8. High Throughput:</h2>
  <p>HDFS is optimized for high throughput and is well-suited for scenarios where large amounts of data need to be ingested, processed, and analyzed in parallel across a distributed environment.</p>

  <h2>9. Integration with Hadoop Ecosystem:</h2>
  <p>HDFS integrates seamlessly with other components of the Hadoop ecosystem, such as MapReduce for distributed data processing, Apache Hive for data warehousing, and Apache Spark for in-memory analytics.</p>

  <h2>10. Web-Based User Interface:</h2>
  <p>HDFS provides a web-based user interface that allows administrators and users to monitor the health and status of the filesystem, view block locations, and manage the HDFS cluster.</p>

  <p>HDFS is a critical component of Apache Hadoop, providing a robust and scalable solution for storing and managing large datasets in distributed computing environments.</p>
