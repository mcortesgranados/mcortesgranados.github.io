    <h1><a href="Amazon DynamoDB.html" target="_blank">Amazon DynamoDB</a></h1>

    <p>
        Amazon DynamoDB is a fully managed NoSQL database service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS).
        It is designed to provide fast and predictable performance with seamless scalability.
    </p>

    <h2>Key Features:</h2>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Managed Service:</strong> DynamoDB is fully managed, meaning AWS takes care of administrative tasks such as hardware or software provisioning, setup, and configuration.</li>
        <li><strong>NoSQL:</strong> It is a NoSQL database, allowing for flexible schema design and efficient handling of large amounts of data with varying structures.</li>
        <li><strong>Scalability:</strong> DynamoDB scales horizontally, automatically distributing data and traffic for the configured throughput capacity.</li>
        <li><strong>Highly Available:</strong> It offers high availability and fault tolerance with automatic and synchronous replication across multiple Availability Zones.</li>
        <li><strong>Security:</strong> DynamoDB provides features like encryption at rest, VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) isolation, and fine-grained access control using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Model:</h2>

    <p>
        DynamoDB uses a key-value and document data model. Each item in a DynamoDB table is uniquely identified by a primary key, and additional attributes can be stored as part of each item.
    </p>

    <h2>Primary Key:</h2>

    <p>
        The primary key can be either a single attribute (Simple Primary Key) or a combination of two attributes (Composite Primary Key). The primary key type determines how the data is distributed across multiple partitions for scalability.
    </p>

    <h2>Usage:</h2>

    <p>
        DynamoDB is suitable for a wide range of applications, including web and mobile applications, gaming, IoT, and more. It provides low-latency access to data and can handle massive-scale applications with ease.
