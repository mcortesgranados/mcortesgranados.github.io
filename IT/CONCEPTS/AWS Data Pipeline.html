    <p>
        AWS Data Pipeline is a web service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that makes it easy to automate the movement and transformation of data between different AWS services and on-premises data sources. It allows you to create, schedule, and manage data-driven workflows to facilitate efficient data processing and analysis.
