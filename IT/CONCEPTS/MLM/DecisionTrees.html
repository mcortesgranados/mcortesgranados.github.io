<h1>Decision Trees Example</h1>

<p>This is a simple example of Decision Trees using Python and scikit-learn.</p>

<h2>Decision Trees Overview</h2>

<p>Decision Trees are a versatile and widely used machine learning algorithm that can be applied to both classification and regression tasks. The model makes decisions based on asking a series of questions about the input features, leading to a prediction. In the case of regression, the output is a continuous value.</p>

<p>Key concepts of Decision Trees:</p>

<ul>
    <li><b>Decision Nodes:</b> Nodes in the tree where a decision is made based on a feature.</li>
    <li><b>Leaf Nodes:</b> Terminal nodes that represent the final output or decision.</li>
    <li><b>Splitting:</b> The process of dividing the dataset into subsets based on the values of a feature.</li>
    <li><b>Criterion:</b> The measure used to evaluate the quality of a split, such as "mean squared error" for regression.</li>
</ul>

<p>Decision Trees are easy to interpret and visualize, making them a popular choice for various applications. However, they are prone to overfitting, and techniques like pruning are often applied to address this issue.</p>

<p>Python Source Code:</p>

<pre><code># Import necessary libraries
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeRegressor
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error

# Generate synthetic data
np.random.seed(42)
X = 2 * np.random.rand(100, 1)
y = 4 + 3 * X + np.random.randn(100, 1)

# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Train the Decision Tree model
model = DecisionTreeRegressor()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions on the test set
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the model
mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)
print(f'Mean Squared Error: {mse}')

# Plot the results
plt.scatter(X_test, y_test, color='black')
plt.plot(X_test, y_pred, color='blue', linewidth=3)
plt.title('Decision Trees Example')
plt.xlabel('X')
plt.ylabel('y')
plt.show()

<p>Explanation:</p>

<ul>
    <li><b>Import Libraries:</b> Import necessary Python libraries, including NumPy for numerical operations, Matplotlib for plotting, and scikit-learn for machine learning.</li>
    <li><b>Generate Synthetic Data:</b> Create synthetic data with a linear relationship and some random noise (similar to the Linear Regression example).</li>
    <li><b>Split Data:</b> Split the data into training and testing sets using the <code>train_test_split</code> function.</li>
    <li><b>Train Model:</b> Create and train a Decision Tree model using scikit-learn's <code>DecisionTreeRegressor</code>.</li>
    <li><b>Make Predictions:</b> Use the trained Decision Tree model to make predictions on the test set.</li>
    <li><b>Evaluate Model:</b> Calculate Mean Squared Error to evaluate the performance of the model.</li>
    <li><b>Plot Results:</b> Plot the actual vs. predicted values for visualization.</li>
</ul>
