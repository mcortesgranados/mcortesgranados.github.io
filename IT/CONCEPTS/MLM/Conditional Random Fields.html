<h1>Conditional Random Fields Example</h1>

<p>This is a simple example of Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) using Python and the sklearn-crfsuite library.</p>

<h2>Conditional Random Fields Overview</h2>

<p>Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) are a type of probabilistic graphical model used for structured prediction tasks. They model the conditional probability of a sequence given an input sequence, making them particularly suitable for tasks such as named entity recognition, part-of-speech tagging, and other sequence labeling problems. CRFs model dependencies between neighboring labels in the output sequence and take input features into account.</p>

<p>Key concepts of Conditional Random Fields:</p>

<ul>
    <li><b>Features:</b> Observable characteristics of the input sequence that are used for prediction.</li>
    <li><b>Potential Functions:</b> Functions that assign scores to label sequences based on the input features.</li>
    <li><b>Transition Features:</b> Features capturing dependencies between neighboring labels in the sequence.</li>
    <li><b>Inference:</b> The process of finding the most likely sequence of labels given the input and learned parameters.</li>
</ul>

<p>CRFs have been widely used in natural language processing and other domains where structured prediction is required.</p>

<pre><code># Import necessary libraries
import sklearn_crfsuite
from sklearn_crfsuite import metrics
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelBinarizer

# Define a simple example dataset for sequence labeling
dataset = [
    [('Word1', 'Noun'), ('Word2', 'Verb'), ('Word3', 'Adjective')],
    [('Word4', 'Noun'), ('Word5', 'Noun'), ('Word6', 'Adverb')],
    # Add more sequences as needed
]

# Split the dataset into training and testing sets
train_data, test_data = train_test_split(dataset, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Extract features and labels from the dataset
def word2features(sent, i):
    word = sent[i][0]
    return {'word': word}

def sent2features(sent):
    return [word2features(sent, i) for i in range(len(sent))]

def sent2labels(sent):
    return [label for word, label in sent]

X_train = [sent2features(sent) for sent in train_data]
y_train = [sent2labels(sent) for sent in train_data]

X_test = [sent2features(sent) for sent in test_data]
y_test = [sent2labels(sent) for sent in test_data]

# Train a CRF model
crf = sklearn_crfsuite.CRF()
crf.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions on the test set
y_pred = crf.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the model
print(f'F1 Score: {metrics.flat_f1_score(y_test, y_pred, average="weighted"):.2f}')
