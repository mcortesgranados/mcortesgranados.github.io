    <h1>OpenCV</h1>

    <p>
        OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is an open-source computer vision and machine learning software library. It provides a wide range of tools and algorithms for image and video processing, computer vision, and machine learning tasks. OpenCV is written in C++ and has bindings for various programming languages, including Python, Java, and more.
