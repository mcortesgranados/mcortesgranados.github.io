<h1 class="style1"><a href="Athena_references_jpg.html" target="_blank">Amazon Athena</a></h1>

<p class="style1">Amazon Athena is an interactive query service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that enables you to analyze and query data stored in Amazon S3 using standard SQL. Athena is a serverless service, meaning you don't need to manage any infrastructure; you only pay for the queries you run.</p>

<h2 class="style1">Key Features of Amazon Athena:</h2>

<ol class="style1">
    <li><strong>Serverless Architecture:</strong> Athena is a serverless service, which means you don't need to provision or manage any infrastructure. You can focus on writing SQL queries to analyze your data stored in Amazon S3.</li>
    
    <!-- ... (other list items) ... -->

    <li><strong>Cost Structure:</strong> With Athena, you pay only for the amount of data scanned by your queries. There are no upfront costs or commitments, and you don't need to manage and scale clusters.</li>
</ol>

<h2 class="style1">Example SQL Query:</h2>

<pre class="style1">
<code>
-- Query data in Athena
SELECT *
FROM "your-database"."your-table"
WHERE column_name = 'some_value';
</code>
</pre>

<p class="style1">To use Amazon Athena, you can use the AWS Management Console, AWS Command Line Interface (CLI), or one of the AWS SDKs. Keep in mind that while Athena is suitable for ad-hoc querying and analysis, for more complex and frequently executed queries, a dedicated data warehouse solution like Amazon Redshift may be more appropriate.</p>
