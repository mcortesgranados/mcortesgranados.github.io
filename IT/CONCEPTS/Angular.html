      <h3>Explain Angular Universal and its role in server-side rendering (SSR).</h3>
      <p>Answer: Angular Universal is a technology that enables server-side rendering (SSR) for Angular applications. SSR improves initial page load performance by rendering Angular components on the server and sending pre-rendered HTML to the client, reducing client-side processing.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h3>What is Angular Ivy, and how does it enhance the performance of Angular applications?</h3>
      <p>Answer: Angular Ivy is the latest rendering engine in Angular. It enhances performance by generating smaller and more efficient JavaScript bundles, improving compilation speed, enabling better tree-shaking, and providing improved debugging and runtime performance.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h3>Explain Angular Elements and its use in creating reusable components.</h3>
      <p>Answer: Angular Elements is a feature that allows the creation of Angular components as custom elements (Web Components). This facilitates the usage of Angular components in non-Angular environments and frameworks, making them reusable across different projects and technologies.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h3>What is Angular Schematics, and how does it streamline project development?</h3>
      <p>Answer: Angular Schematics is a workflow tool that automates the creation, modification, and maintenance of Angular projects. It streamlines project development by providing a way to generate boilerplate code, add components, modules, services, and perform other common tasks, improving consistency across projects.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h3>Explain the concept of Angular ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush and when to use it.</h3>
      <p>Answer: ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush is a change detection strategy in Angular that makes the framework check for changes only when the component's inputs change or when an event is triggered. It's useful for optimizing performance in components where the data doesn't change frequently, reducing unnecessary checks.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h3>What is Angular ngUpgrade, and how does it facilitate the migration of AngularJS to Angular?</h3>
      <p>Answer: Angular ngUpgrade is a library that helps in the gradual migration of AngularJS (Angular 1.x) applications to Angular. It allows both frameworks to run simultaneously, enabling developers to upgrade components and services incrementally rather than requiring a complete rewrite of the application.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h3>Explain Angular Zone.js and its role in managing asynchronous operations.</h3>
      <p>Answer: Angular Zone.js is a library that helps Angular manage asynchronous tasks and events. It provides a zone context for execution, allowing Angular to track asynchronous operations and trigger change detection when needed. Zone.js is fundamental to Angular's change detection mechanism.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h3>What is Angular AOT (Ahead-of-Time) compilation, and how does it differ from JIT (Just-in-Time) compilation?</h3>
      <p>Answer: Angular AOT compilation is a build process that compiles Angular applications at build time rather than at runtime. It results in smaller bundle sizes, faster rendering, and improved security. JIT compilation, on the other hand, compiles the application in the browser at runtime.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h3>Explain Angular Zone-less change detection and when it might be useful.</h3>
      <p>Answer: Angular Zone-less change detection involves running change detection outside the Angular zone. This can be useful in scenarios where you want to optimize performance by reducing the frequency of change detection checks or when integrating with third-party libraries that don't play well with zones.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h3>What is Angular Microfrontends, and how does it enable the development of modular, independently deployable components?</h3>
      <p>Answer: Angular Microfrontends is an architectural pattern that involves breaking a large Angular application into smaller, independently deployable micro-applications. Each micro-app serves as a standalone Angular application, allowing teams to work on and deploy components independently, promoting modularity and scalability.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h3>Explain Angular i18n and how it supports internationalization in Angular applications.</h3>
      <p>Answer: Angular i18n is a feature that supports internationalization (i18n) in Angular applications. It allows developers to create multilingual applications by providing tools for translating text and formatting dates, numbers, and currencies based on the user's locale.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h3>What is Angular ngModule providers and how do they influence dependency injection?</h3>
      <p>Answer: In Angular ngModule, providers are used to configure the dependency injection system. They define how instances of services are created and injected throughout the application. Understanding ngModule providers is crucial for controlling the scope and lifecycle of services in Angular applications.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h3>Explain Angular Dynamic Component Loader and its applications in runtime component creation.</h3>
      <p>Answer: Angular Dynamic Component Loader allows the dynamic creation and loading of components at runtime. This is useful when the components needed are determined dynamically, enabling scenarios such as dynamic forms, dialogs, or components loaded based on user interactions or external configurations.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h3>What is Angular TestBed and how is it used in testing Angular applications?</h3>
      <p>Answer: Angular TestBed is a utility in Angular for configuring and creating instances of Angular testing modules. It is a key tool for testing Angular components, services, and other units of code. TestBed provides methods to configure dependencies, mock services, and create instances for testing purposes.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h3>Explain Angular Ivy's Differential Loading and how it optimizes the delivery of JavaScript bundles to modern and legacy browsers.</h3>
      <p>Answer: Angular Ivy's Differential Loading is a feature that optimizes the delivery of JavaScript bundles by generating separate bundles for modern and legacy browsers. Modern browsers receive a smaller, more efficient bundle, while legacy browsers receive a larger bundle with additional polyfills, ensuring optimal performance for each browser type.</p>
