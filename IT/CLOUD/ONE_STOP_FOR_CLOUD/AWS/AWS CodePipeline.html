<p><strong>AWS CodePipeline: Continuous Delivery and Automation</strong></p>
<p>AWS CodePipeline is a fully managed continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) service that automates the build, test, and deployment phases of releasing software. It facilitates the creation and management of end-to-end pipelines for building, testing, and deploying applications on AWS. Here's a comprehensive list of AWS CodePipeline features along with their definitions:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Pipeline Workflow:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Definition:</strong> Allows users to define a series of stages and actions to represent the end-to-end workflow of building, testing, and deploying code changes.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Source Integration:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Definition:</strong> Integrates with various source code repositories, including AWS CodeCommit, GitHub, Bitbucket, and others. Automatically triggers pipeline execution upon code changes.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Build Providers:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Definition:</strong> Supports integration with popular build providers such as AWS CodeBuild, Jenkins, and others. Executes build processes to compile and package application code.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Automated Testing:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Definition:</strong> Facilitates the integration of automated testing tools and frameworks. Allows users to define test phases within the pipeline to validate code changes.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Deployment Providers:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Definition:</strong> Integrates with deployment providers such as AWS Elastic Beanstalk, AWS Lambda, AWS Fargate, and others. Automates the deployment of applications to various AWS services.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Custom Actions:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Definition:</strong> Users can define custom actions to extend pipeline functionality. This allows for integration with third-party tools or the execution of custom scripts.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Parallel Execution:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Definition:</strong> Supports parallel execution of multiple stages and actions within a pipeline. This optimizes the overall pipeline execution time.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Artifact Management:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Definition:</strong> Manages artifacts generated during the build process, such as compiled code and application packages. Artifacts are passed between pipeline stages for deployment.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Manual Approval Steps:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Definition:</strong> Allows users to insert manual approval steps within the pipeline. This ensures that certain stages require manual verification before proceeding to the next phase.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Pipeline Monitoring:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Definition:</strong> Provides a visual representation of pipeline execution, including the status of each stage and action. Users can monitor and troubleshoot pipeline runs.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Integration with AWS CloudWatch:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Definition:</strong> Integrates with AWS CloudWatch for logging and monitoring pipeline activity. Users can set up alarms and notifications based on pipeline execution events.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Event Integration with AWS Services:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Definition:</strong> Triggers pipeline execution based on events from other AWS services. For example, a pipeline can be triggered automatically upon code commits or CloudWatch Events.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Integration with AWS CodeDeploy:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Definition:</strong> Seamlessly integrates with AWS CodeDeploy for application deployment. Users can deploy applications to EC2 instances, Lambda functions, or on-premises environments.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Source Artifact Tracking:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Definition:</strong> Tracks source artifacts through the pipeline stages. Users can trace the version and changeset of the source code through the build and deployment phases.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Cross-Account and Cross-Region Pipelines:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Definition:</strong> Allows the creation of pipelines that span multiple AWS accounts and regions. This is useful for deploying applications in complex or distributed environments.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Pipeline as Code:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Definition:</strong> Supports defining and managing pipelines using AWS CloudFormation. This enables Infrastructure as Code (IaC) practices for pipeline creation and management.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Integration with AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM):</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Definition:</strong> Integrates with IAM for access control. Users can define roles and permissions to control who can create, modify, and execute pipelines.</li>
