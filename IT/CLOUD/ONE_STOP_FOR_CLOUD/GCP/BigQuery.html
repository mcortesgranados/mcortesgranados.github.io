<p><strong>Google BigQuery: Serverless, Highly Scalable, and Cost-effective Data Warehouse</strong></p>
<p>Google BigQuery is a fully managed, serverless data warehouse that enables organizations to analyze large datasets in real-time using SQL queries. It is a key component of Google Cloud Platform's data analytics and business intelligence offerings. Here's a comprehensive list of Google BigQuery features along with their definitions:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Serverless Architecture:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Definition:</strong> BigQuery is serverless, meaning users do not need to provision or manage infrastructure. It automatically scales resources based on the complexity and size of the query.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Distributed Computing:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Definition:</strong> BigQuery utilizes a distributed computing architecture, breaking down large queries into smaller tasks that run in parallel across multiple nodes. This ensures high-performance processing of large datasets.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>SQL Queries:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Definition:</strong> BigQuery supports standard SQL queries, making it accessible to users familiar with SQL syntax. This enables organizations to leverage existing SQL skills for data analysis.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Real-time Data Analysis:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Definition:</strong> BigQuery is designed for real-time data analysis, allowing users to query and analyze large datasets instantly. This is crucial for making data-driven decisions with up-to-date information.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Integration with Cloud Storage:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Definition:</strong> BigQuery seamlessly integrates with Google Cloud Storage, enabling users to query data directly from Cloud Storage or load data into BigQuery from Cloud Storage.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Managed Data Storage:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Definition:</strong> BigQuery provides managed data storage with automatic backups. Users can store and manage large datasets without worrying about infrastructure maintenance.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Standard and Streaming Ingestion:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Definition:</strong> BigQuery supports both batch and streaming data ingestion. Users can load data in batches or stream data in real-time for continuous analysis.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Data Encryption:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Definition:</strong> BigQuery encrypts data at rest and in transit by default. This ensures the security of sensitive information stored and processed in BigQuery.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Fine-grained Access Control:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Definition:</strong> BigQuery offers fine-grained access control, allowing users to control access to datasets, tables, and views. Access permissions can be set at the project, dataset, or table level.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Integration with IAM:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Definition:</strong> BigQuery integrates with Google Cloud Identity and Access Management (IAM), allowing organizations to manage access control and permissions using IAM roles.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Geospatial Capabilities:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Definition:</strong> BigQuery provides geospatial functions and capabilities for analyzing and querying geospatial data. This is particularly useful for location-based analytics.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Machine Learning Integration:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Definition:</strong> BigQuery ML allows users to build and deploy machine learning models directly in BigQuery using SQL queries, without the need for separate machine learning tools.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Data Transfer Services:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Definition:</strong> BigQuery Data Transfer Service allows users to automate the loading of data from various Google services, such as Google Ads and Google Analytics, into BigQuery for analysis.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Data Partitioning and Clustering:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Definition:</strong> BigQuery supports data partitioning and clustering to optimize query performance. Partitioning and clustering are used to organize and store data more efficiently.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Materialized Views:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Definition:</strong> BigQuery supports materialized views, which are precomputed views that store the results of a query. This enhances query performance by reducing the need to recompute results for frequently executed queries.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Audit Logging and Monitoring:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Definition:</strong> BigQuery provides audit logs for tracking access and changes to datasets. It also integrates with Google Cloud Monitoring for real-time monitoring of query performance and resource usage.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Cost Controls:</strong></p>
    <ul>
