<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Configure Rules:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Configure rules in your security policy to define how traffic should be treated. For example, create a rule to block SQL injection attacks.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>gcloud compute security-policies rules create my-sql-injection-rule \<br />
--security-policy=my-security-policy \<br />
--expression=&quot;request.http_request.matched_url_path.matches('.*\b(SELECT|UNION)\b.*')&quot;<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Attach Security Policy to Backend Service:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Attach the security policy to your backend service or load balancer.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>gcloud compute backend-services update my-backend-service \<br />
--security-policy=my-security-policy<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>View Security Policies:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>List existing security policies to verify the configuration.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>gcloud compute security-policies list<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Update Security Policy (Optional):</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Update the security policy if needed. For example, add more rules or modify existing ones.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
