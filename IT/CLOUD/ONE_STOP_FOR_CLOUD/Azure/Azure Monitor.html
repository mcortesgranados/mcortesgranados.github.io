  Azure Monitor: Overview and Configuration Example</strong></p>
<p>Azure Monitor is a comprehensive service in Microsoft Azure that provides a unified platform for monitoring and managing the performance and health of your Azure resources and applications. It offers a suite of tools and services for collecting, analyzing, and acting on telemetry data from various sources. Here's an overview of Azure Monitor along with a configuration example:</p>
<h3>Components of Azure Monitor:</h3>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Azure Monitor Metrics:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Collects numerical data (metrics) from Azure resources, allowing you to monitor their performance and health. Metrics can include CPU usage, disk I/O, and more.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Azure Monitor Logs:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Allows you to collect and analyze log and performance data from various sources using Azure Log Analytics. It supports custom logs, and you can query and visualize the data.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Application Insights:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>A feature within Azure Monitor that helps you monitor the performance and usage of your applications. It provides insights into application telemetry, exceptions, and user interactions.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Azure Monitor Alerts:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Enables you to create and manage alerts based on defined conditions. When an alert is triggered, you can take automated actions.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Azure Monitor Workbooks:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Provides a customizable and interactive experience for data analysis and visualization. You can create dashboards, reports, and visualizations based on your monitoring data.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Azure Monitor Application Insights Profiler:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Allows you to profile the performance of your application in real-time, helping you identify and diagnose performance issues.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>
<h3>Configuration Example:</h3>
<p>Let's configure Azure Monitor for a sample scenario:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Login to Azure Portal:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Navigate to the <a target="_new" href="https://portal.azure.com/">Azure Portal</a>.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Create an Azure Monitor Workspace:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Click on &quot;Create a resource&quot; and search for &quot;Azure Monitor.&quot;</li>
      <li>Select &quot;Azure Monitor&quot; and click &quot;Create&quot; to start the Azure Monitor workspace creation.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Configure Azure Monitor Workspace Settings:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Specify details such as subscription, resource group, workspace name, region, and pricing tier.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Enable Azure Monitor Metrics for Resources:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Navigate to the resource you want to monitor (e.g., a virtual machine) and enable Azure Monitor Metrics for that resource.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Configure Azure Monitor Logs (Optional):</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>If you want to collect and analyze log data, configure Azure Monitor Logs using Azure Log Analytics. Create and customize log queries to suit your requirements.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Enable Application Insights (Optional):</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>If you have applications you want to monitor, enable Application Insights and instrument your application code to send telemetry data.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Create Azure Monitor Alerts:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Define alert rules based on metrics or log data. For example, you could create an alert that triggers when CPU usage on a virtual machine exceeds a certain threshold.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Configure Azure Monitor Workbooks:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Create workbooks to visualize and analyze data. You can create custom dashboards and reports based on your monitoring needs.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Integrate with Azure DevOps (Optional):</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>If you're using Azure DevOps, integrate Azure Monitor with your CI/CD pipelines for continuous monitoring and feedback.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Monitor and Respond to Alerts:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Regularly monitor alerts and take necessary actions when an alert is triggered. This may include scaling resources, investigating issues, or triggering automated remediation.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Use Azure Monitor Application Insights Profiler (Optional):</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>If you have performance profiling requirements, use the Application Insights Profiler to gain real-time insights into your application's performance.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Review and Optimize:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Periodically review your monitoring setup, optimize alert rules, and adjust configurations based on changing application and infrastructure needs.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Clean Up Resources:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Once done, clean up resources by deleting the Azure Monitor workspace or specific resources as needed.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>
