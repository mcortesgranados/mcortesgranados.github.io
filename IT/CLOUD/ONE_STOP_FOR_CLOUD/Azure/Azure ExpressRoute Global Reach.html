<p><strong>Azure ExpressRoute Global Reach: Overview and Configuration Example</strong></p>
<p>Azure ExpressRoute Global Reach extends the capabilities of Azure ExpressRoute to enable private connectivity between geographically dispersed locations. It facilitates communication between on-premises networks connected to ExpressRoute circuits in different geopolitical boundaries. Here's a detailed overview of Azure ExpressRoute Global Reach along with a configuration example:</p>
<h3>Features of Azure ExpressRoute Global Reach:</h3>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Global Network Connectivity:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Enables private connectivity across global ExpressRoute circuits, allowing communication between on-premises locations in different regions.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Private Peering:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Utilizes private peering to establish private connections between on-premises networks, maintaining privacy and security.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Transitive Routing:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Supports transitive routing, allowing traffic to flow through multiple ExpressRoute circuits to reach the destination.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Hub-and-Spoke Topology:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Facilitates the creation of hub-and-spoke network architectures for centralized connectivity and traffic control.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Centralized Management:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Provides centralized management of ExpressRoute connections and circuits through the Azure Portal.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>
<h3>Configuration Example:</h3>
<p>Let's configure Azure ExpressRoute Global Reach between two ExpressRoute circuits in different regions:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>ExpressRoute Circuit Setup:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>In the Azure Portal, navigate to the &quot;ExpressRoute circuits&quot; section.</li>
      <li>Create ExpressRoute circuits for each on-premises location. Ensure that each circuit is associated with a different geopolitical region.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Provider Configuration:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Coordinate with the ExpressRoute service provider to configure the necessary settings for each ExpressRoute circuit.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Create Private Peering:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>In the configuration of each ExpressRoute circuit, set up private peering with the respective on-premises network.</li>
      <li>Ensure that the IP addresses used for the private peering are unique and do not overlap.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Enable ExpressRoute Global Reach:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>In the configuration of each ExpressRoute circuit, enable ExpressRoute Global Reach.</li>
      <li>Specify the peer's AS number and the connection key provided by the ExpressRoute service provider.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Hub-and-Spoke Topology (Optional):</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>If deploying a hub-and-spoke architecture, configure one ExpressRoute circuit as the hub and the others as spokes.</li>
      <li>Ensure that transitive routing is allowed for traffic to flow through the hub to reach other spokes.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Routing Considerations:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Configure routing on on-premises routers to route traffic through the ExpressRoute circuits appropriately.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Transitive Routing (Optional):</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Test transitive routing by sending traffic between on-premises locations connected to different ExpressRoute circuits.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Monitor Connectivity:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Monitor connectivity using Azure Network Watcher or other monitoring tools to ensure that traffic flows as expected.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Centralized Management:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Manage and monitor all ExpressRoute circuits and connections centrally through the Azure Portal.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Clean Up Resources:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Once done, clean up resources by deleting the ExpressRoute circuits or specific resources as needed.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>
