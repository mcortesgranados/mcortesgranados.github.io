    <h2>1. What are 'Conditional Formatting' rules in Oracle Reports?</h2>
    <p>'Conditional Formatting' rules allow you to change the appearance of report elements based on specific conditions or data values.</p>
    <pre>
    -- Example of conditional formatting in a report
    IF :sales_amount &gt; 10000 THEN
        SET_ITEM_PROPERTY('sales_amount', FONT_COLOR, 'RED');
    ELSE
        SET_ITEM_PROPERTY('sales_amount', FONT_COLOR, 'BLACK');
    END IF;
    </pre>

    <h2>2. How do you use 'User Parameters' in Oracle Reports?</h2>
    <p>'User Parameters' allow users to input values at runtime, which can then be used in queries or report logic to customize the report output.</p>
    <pre>
    -- Example of using a user parameter in a SQL Query
    SELECT * FROM orders
    WHERE order_date BETWEEN :start_date AND :end_date;
    </pre>

    <h2>3. What is a 'Sub-Report' and how is it used in Oracle Reports?</h2>
    <p>A 'Sub-Report' is a report embedded within another report, used to display related data or detailed information within a main report.</p>

    <h2>4. How can you optimize the performance of Oracle Reports?</h2>
    <p>Optimize performance by using efficient SQL queries, minimizing data retrieval, reducing report complexity, and using indexes where applicable.</p>

    <h2>5. How do you include 'Calculated Columns' in Oracle Reports?</h2>
    <p>Include 'Calculated Columns' by defining formulas or expressions in the reportâ€™s data model to compute values based on other data fields.</p>
    <pre>
    -- Example of a calculated column
    SELECT employee_id, salary, salary * 0.10 AS bonus
    FROM employees;
    </pre>

    <h2>6. What is 'Report Trigger' and how do you use it?</h2>

    <h2>7. How do you handle 'Long Text Fields' in Oracle Reports?</h2>
    <p>Handle 'Long Text Fields' by adjusting the layout to accommodate large text blocks and using text formatting options to ensure proper display.</p>

    <p>A 'Running Total' calculates cumulative values across a set of records, useful for summaries and totals within a report.</p>
    <pre>
    -- Example of running total calculation
    SELECT department_id, employee_id, salary,
           SUM(salary) OVER (PARTITION BY department_id) AS running_total
    FROM employees;
    </pre>

    <h2>9. How can you handle 'Dynamic Data Sources' in Oracle Reports?</h2>
    <p>Handle 'Dynamic Data Sources' by using parameters and bind variables to adjust the data source or query based on user input or conditions.</p>

    <h2>10. How do you create 'Interactive Reports' in Oracle Reports?</h2>
    <p>Create 'Interactive Reports' by configuring report parameters, adding interactive elements like filters and drill-downs, and ensuring the report layout supports dynamic interactio
