<h1>Azure API Management Q&A - Part 05</h1>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">1. What is the Developer Portal in Azure API Management?</h2>
    <p>The Developer Portal is a customizable website where developers can discover, learn about, and test APIs managed by Azure API Management. It provides documentation, API keys, and a test console.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">2. How can you secure APIs in Azure API Management?</h2>
    <p>APIs can be secured using policies that enforce authentication methods such as OAuth 2.0, API keys, or certificates to ensure only authorized users can access the APIs.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">3. What is the difference between a product and an API in Azure API Management?</h2>
    <p>An API represents a specific set of operations exposed by a backend service, while a product is a container that groups multiple APIs and defines access policies and subscription levels for those APIs.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">4. How does Azure API Management handle versioning of APIs?</h2>
    <p>Azure API Management allows versioning of APIs through the use of URL segments or query parameters, enabling multiple versions of an API to coexist and be accessed by clients.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">5. What is the purpose of policies in Azure API Management?</h2>
    <p>Policies in Azure API Management allow you to implement various features such as authentication, rate limiting, transformation, and logging at different stages of the API request/response lifecycle.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">6. Can you integrate Azure API Management with Azure Logic Apps?</h2>
    <p>Yes, Azure API Management can be integrated with Azure Logic Apps to automate workflows and orchestrate tasks using the APIs exposed by the API Management service.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">7. What is a Subscription Key in Azure API Management?</h2>
    <p>A Subscription Key is a unique identifier that clients must include in their requests to access APIs, providing a means of controlling access and usage tracking.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">8. How can you monitor API performance in Azure API Management?</h2>
    <p>API performance can be monitored using Azure Monitor, which provides metrics and logs related to API usage, response times, and error rates, helping identify performance issues.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">9. What types of backends can Azure API Management connect to?</h2>
    <p>Azure API Management can connect to various backends, including Azure services (like Azure Functions, App Services, and Azure SQL Database), on-premises services, and external HTTP services.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">10. What are "policies expressions" in Azure API Management?</h2>
    <p>Policies expressions allow you to write custom logic in policies using a scripting language, enabling dynamic behavior and advanced processing based on request or response data.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">11. How can you implement IP filtering in Azure API Management?</h2>
    <p>IP filtering can be implemented using policies that allow or deny access to APIs based on the client's IP address, enhancing security by restricting access to trusted sources.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">12. Can Azure API Management automatically generate SDKs for APIs?</h2>
    <p>Yes, Azure API Management can automatically generate SDKs for APIs in various programming languages, making it easier for developers to integrate and use the APIs in their applications.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">13. What is the significance of the API gateway in Azure API Management?</h2>
    <p>The API gateway acts as a fa√ßade for backend services, managing all API requests, applying security and routing policies, and providing a unified entry point for clients.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">14. How do you test APIs in Azure API Management?</h2>
    <p>APIs can be tested directly in the Developer Portal using the built-in test console, which allows developers to make API calls and view responses in real-time.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">15. What are some common use cases for Azure API Management?</h2>
    <p>Common use cases include exposing microservices, creating unified API gateways for legacy systems, enabling B2B integrations, and managing APIs for mobile applications.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">16. How does Azure API Management support analytics and reporting?</h2>
    <p>Azure API Management integrates with Azure Monitor and Application Insights, allowing detailed analytics and reporting on API usage, performance metrics, and user engagement.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">17. Can you configure custom domains for Azure API Management?</h2>
    <p>Yes, you can configure custom domains for your Azure API Management instance to provide a branded experience for your API consumers.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">18. What is the impact of using a self-hosted gateway in Azure API Management?</h2>
    <p>A self-hosted gateway allows you to run the API Management gateway on-premises or in other cloud environments, enabling integration with legacy systems and maintaining local data privacy.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">19. How do you apply security policies in Azure API Management?</h2>
    <p>Security policies can be applied at different levels (global, product, or API level) in the Azure portal, specifying how requests should be authenticated and validated.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">20. What is "DevOps" integration in Azure API Management?</h2>
    <p>DevOps integration allows you to automate API deployment and configuration changes using CI/CD pipelines, ensuring that APIs can be managed and deployed efficiently across environments.</p>
