<h1>Azure API Management Q&A - Part 09</h1>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">1. What is Azure API Management?</h2>
    <p>Azure API Management is a cloud service that allows you to create, publish, secure, and analyze APIs in a scalable way.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">2. How do you implement rate limiting in Azure API Management?</h2>
    <p>Rate limiting can be implemented using policies that control the number of calls an API can receive from a client within a specified time period.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">3. What are the main components of Azure API Management?</h2>
    <p>The main components include the API gateway, Developer Portal, management plane, and analytics capabilities.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">4. How do you secure APIs using Azure API Management?</h2>
    <p>APIs can be secured using OAuth 2.0, API keys, IP filtering, and by configuring HTTPS for all API calls.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">5. Can you integrate Azure API Management with Azure Active Directory?</h2>
    <p>Yes, Azure API Management can be integrated with Azure Active Directory for user authentication and authorization in a seamless manner.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">6. What is the Developer Portal in Azure API Management?</h2>
    <p>The Developer Portal is a customizable website where developers can discover, explore, and test APIs, as well as obtain subscription keys.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">7. How do you monitor API performance in Azure API Management?</h2>
    <p>API performance can be monitored using Azure Monitor and Application Insights, which provide detailed metrics and logs for API calls.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">8. What is an API policy in Azure API Management?</h2>
    <p>An API policy is a set of rules that define how the API should behave, allowing you to modify requests and responses dynamically.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">9. How can you version APIs in Azure API Management?</h2>
    <p>APIs can be versioned by adding versioning schemes, such as URL path versioning or query string versioning, to distinguish between different API versions.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">10. Can Azure API Management help with API discovery?</h2>
    <p>Yes, it provides a Developer Portal where APIs are documented, allowing developers to easily discover and understand available APIs.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">11. How do you implement caching in Azure API Management?</h2>
    <p>Caching can be implemented by using the caching policies to store responses for a specified duration, reducing backend load and improving performance.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">12. What is the purpose of the "set-variable" policy?</h2>
    <p>The set-variable policy allows you to define and store values during the processing of requests or responses, which can be referenced later in the policy execution.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">13. Can you protect APIs with IP filtering?</h2>
    <p>Yes, IP filtering can be used to restrict access to APIs based on the client's IP address, enhancing security by allowing only specified IPs.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">14. What are the benefits of using Azure API Management for microservices?</h2>
    <p>It simplifies API management, enhances security, facilitates API versioning, and provides analytics and monitoring, which are critical for microservices architecture.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">15. How do you add a new API to Azure API Management?</h2>
    <p>A new API can be added through the Azure portal by importing an existing API definition (OpenAPI, WSDL, etc.) or manually creating a new API with endpoints.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">16. Can Azure API Management integrate with Logic Apps?</h2>
    <p>Yes, Azure API Management can be integrated with Azure Logic Apps, allowing you to create workflows that can call APIs managed by API Management.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">17. What is the "transform" policy used for?</h2>
    <p>The transform policy is used to modify the body of requests or responses, allowing you to change the format or content dynamically.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">18. How can you automate the deployment of Azure API Management?</h2>
    <p>Automated deployments can be achieved using Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates, Azure CLI, or PowerShell scripts to provision and configure API Management instances.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">19. How do you configure custom domains in Azure API Management?</h2>
    <p>Custom domains can be configured through the Azure portal, allowing you to assign your own domain names to the API Management gateway and Developer Portal.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">20. What is the role of policies in Azure API Management?</h2>
    <p>Policies in Azure API Management provide a way to implement rules and transformations that control the behavior of APIs, such as authentication, validation, and logging.</p>
