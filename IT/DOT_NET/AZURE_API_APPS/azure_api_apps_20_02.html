    <div class="qa">
        <p class="question">8. How does Azure API Apps facilitate microservices architecture?</p>
        <p class="answer">Azure API Apps enable the creation of microservices by allowing individual APIs to be developed, deployed, and managed independently, enhancing scalability and maintainability.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="qa">
        <p class="question">9. What is the importance of using API definitions in Azure API Apps?</p>
        <p class="answer">API definitions, often in OpenAPI/Swagger format, provide a standard way to describe API endpoints, request/response formats, and authentication methods, improving clarity and usability.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="qa">
        <p class="question">10. Can Azure API Apps handle high traffic loads?</p>
        <p class="answer">Yes, Azure API Apps can handle high traffic loads through automatic scaling, allowing applications to grow in response to demand without downtime.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="qa">
        <p class="question">11. What is the process to monitor API performance in Azure API Apps?</p>
        <p class="answer">API performance can be monitored using Azure Application Insights, which provides real-time telemetry data and insights into performance metrics and user interactions.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="qa">
        <p class="question">12. How can you implement logging in Azure API Apps?</p>
        <p class="answer">Logging can be implemented using built-in logging features, Application Insights, or third-party logging frameworks like Serilog or NLog to capture and analyze log data.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="qa">
        <p class="question">13. What are API keys, and how are they used in Azure API Apps?</p>
