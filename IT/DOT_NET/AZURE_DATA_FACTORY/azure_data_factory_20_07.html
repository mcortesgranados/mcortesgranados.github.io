<h1>Azure Data Factory Q&A - Part 07</h1>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">1. What is an Azure Data Factory pipeline?</h2>
    <p>An Azure Data Factory pipeline is a logical grouping of activities that together perform a task, such as data movement, transformation, and processing.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">2. What is the role of the Data Flow in Azure Data Factory?</h2>
    <p>The Data Flow in Azure Data Factory allows users to design complex data transformation workflows visually, enabling transformations without writing code.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">3. How can you monitor the activity runs in Azure Data Factory?</h2>
    <p>You can monitor activity runs in Azure Data Factory through the Azure portal, where you can view the status, duration, and any errors for each activity.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">4. What are linked services in Azure Data Factory?</h2>
    <p>Linked services in Azure Data Factory are connections to external data sources, defining the connection string and authentication to access the data.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">5. Can you schedule pipelines to run at specific times in Azure Data Factory?</h2>
    <p>Yes, you can schedule pipelines to run at specific times using triggers in Azure Data Factory, including scheduled and event-based triggers.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">6. What is the purpose of using the Debug mode in Azure Data Factory?</h2>
    <p>The Debug mode allows users to test and validate their pipelines interactively, enabling them to run activities step-by-step to troubleshoot issues.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">7. How does Azure Data Factory ensure security for data in transit?</h2>
    <p>Azure Data Factory ensures security for data in transit by using encrypted connections (TLS) and providing secure access through managed identities and role-based access control.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">8. Can Azure Data Factory perform real-time data integration?</h2>
    <p>Azure Data Factory primarily focuses on batch processing; however, it can work with real-time data through event-driven architectures and integration with Azure Stream Analytics.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">9. What is the role of the Integration Runtime in Azure Data Factory?</h2>
    <p>The Integration Runtime in Azure Data Factory is the compute infrastructure used to provide data integration capabilities, allowing data movement and transformation across various environments.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">10. What is the difference between a scheduled trigger and an event-based trigger in Azure Data Factory?</h2>
    <p>A scheduled trigger runs pipelines at specified intervals, while an event-based trigger runs pipelines in response to events occurring in Azure Blob Storage or Event Hubs.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">11. Can you use Azure Data Factory to copy data from Azure Blob Storage to Azure SQL Database?</h2>
    <p>Yes, Azure Data Factory can copy data from Azure Blob Storage to Azure SQL Database using a copy activity defined in a pipeline.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">12. How do you handle failures in Azure Data Factory pipelines?</h2>
    <p>You can handle failures in Azure Data Factory pipelines by using retry policies, error handling activities, and configuring alerts to notify stakeholders of issues.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">13. What types of data transformations can you perform in Azure Data Factory?</h2>
    <p>You can perform various data transformations in Azure Data Factory, including filtering, aggregating, joining, and sorting data using Mapping Data Flows.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">14. Can Azure Data Factory integrate with Power BI?</h2>
    <p>Yes, Azure Data Factory can integrate with Power BI by preparing data for visualization and enabling data movement to Power BI datasets.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">15. What are parameters and variables in Azure Data Factory?</h2>
    <p>Parameters are used to pass values into pipelines and activities at runtime, while variables are used to store values that can be modified during pipeline execution.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">16. How do you implement CI/CD for Azure Data Factory?</h2>
    <p>CI/CD for Azure Data Factory can be implemented using Azure DevOps, enabling source control, automated testing, and deployment of data factory resour
