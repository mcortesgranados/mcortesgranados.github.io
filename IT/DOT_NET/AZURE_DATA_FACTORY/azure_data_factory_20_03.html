<h1>Azure Data Factory Q&A - Part 03</h1>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">1. What is a pipeline in Azure Data Factory?</h2>
    <p>A pipeline is a logical grouping of activities in Azure Data Factory that together perform a task, allowing for orchestration of data workflows.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">2. Can you define parameters in Azure Data Factory pipelines?</h2>
    <p>Yes, you can define parameters in Azure Data Factory pipelines, allowing you to pass dynamic values to pipelines at runtime.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">3. How does Azure Data Factory support hybrid data integration?</h2>
    <p>Azure Data Factory supports hybrid data integration by enabling connectivity to on-premises data sources through a self-hosted integration runtime, alongside cloud-based services.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">4. What are data flows in Azure Data Factory?</h2>
    <p>Data flows in Azure Data Factory provide a visual way to design data transformation logic using a graphical interface, enabling complex data transformations without writing code.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">5. What is the difference between a dataset and a linked service?</h2>
    <p>A dataset represents the structure of the data within a data store, while a linked service defines the connection information needed to connect to that data store.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">6. How can you manage versioning in Azure Data Factory?</h2>
    <p>Versioning in Azure Data Factory can be managed using Git integration, which allows you to track changes, collaborate, and revert to previous versions of your pipelines and data flows.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">7. Can you automate the deployment of Azure Data Factory resources?</h2>
    <p>Yes, Azure Data Factory resources can be automated and deployed using Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates, Azure DevOps, or GitHub Actions.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">8. What is a trigger in Azure Data Factory?</h2>
    <p>A trigger in Azure Data Factory is a way to initiate a pipeline run based on a schedule, an event, or a specific condition.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">9. How can you monitor the performance of Azure Data Factory pipelines?</h2>
    <p>Performance monitoring can be done through the Azure portal, where you can view activity runs, pipeline runs, and performance metrics, as well as set up alerts.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">10. What types of data transformation operations can you perform in data flows?</h2>
    <p>In data flows, you can perform various transformation operations, including aggregations, joins, filters, derived columns, and conditional splits.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">11. What is a mapping data flow in Azure Data Factory?</h2>
    <p>A mapping data flow is a visual data transformation feature in Azure Data Factory that allows you to design and execute data transformations without writing code.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">12. How does Azure Data Factory handle large datasets?</h2>
    <p>Azure Data Factory handles large datasets by allowing for parallel processing and partitioning, as well as using scalable compute resources in Azure.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">13. Can you integrate Azure Data Factory with Azure Logic Apps?</h2>
    <p>Yes, Azure Data Factory can be integrated with Azure Logic Apps to trigger workflows based on data movement and processing events.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">14. How do you handle error handling in Azure Data Factory?</h2>
    <p>Error handling in Azure Data Factory can be managed by configuring retries for activities, using error paths in data flows, and monitoring activity run outputs.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">15. What are the different integration runtimes available in Azure Data Factory?</h2>
    <p>Azure Data Factory offers three types of integration runtimes: Azure Integration Runtime (cloud-based), Self-hosted Integration Runtime (on-premises), and Azure-SSIS Integration Runtime (for running SSIS packages).</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">16. How can you perform data validation in Azure Data Factory?</h2>
    <p>Data validation can be performed using validation activities, lookup activities, and conditional statements within data flows or pipelines to ensure data quality before processing.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">17. What role does Azure Data Lake Storage play in Azure Data Factory?</h2>
    <p>Azure Data Lake Storage serves as a scalable data repository that can be used as a source or sink for Azure Data Factory, enabling efficient storage and processing of large datasets.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">18. Can Azure Data Factory be used for real-time data processing?</h2>
    <p>While Azure Data Factory is primarily designed for batch data processing, it can be used for near-real-time data integration when combined with event-driven architectures and services like Azure Stream Analytics.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">19. What is the use of parameters in data flows?</h2>
    <p>Parameters in data flows allow you to pass dynamic values at runtime, making data flows reusable and adaptable to different scenarios.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">20. How does Azure Data Factory support data governance?</h2>
    <p>Azure Data Factory supports data governance by providing features such as data lineage tracking, integration with Azure Purview, and robust auditing and monitoring capabilities.</p>
