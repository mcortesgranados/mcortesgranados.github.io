<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">3. What is the difference between a copy activity and a data flow activity?</h2>
    <p>A copy activity is primarily used to transfer data from a source to a destination, while a data flow activity is used for transforming data within Azure Data Factory.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">4. Can Azure Data Factory connect to both cloud and on-premises data sources?</h2>
    <p>Yes, Azure Data Factory can connect to both cloud and on-premises data sources using linked services and Integration Runtimes.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">5. How can you ensure data integrity during data movement in Azure Data Factory?</h2>
    <p>Data integrity can be ensured by implementing validation checks, using error handling and logging features, and monitoring pipeline runs for anomalies.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">6. What is a Self-hosted Integration Runtime in Azure Data Factory?</h2>
    <p>A Self-hosted Integration Runtime allows users to connect to on-premises data sources and services securely, enabling data integration and movement to and from Azure.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">7. How do you implement monitoring and alerting in Azure Data Factory?</h2>
    <p>Monitoring and alerting can be implemented through the Azure portal by setting up alerts based on pipeline activity failures, metrics, and diagnostic logs.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">8. What are triggers in Azure Data Factory?</h2>
    <p>Triggers in Azure Data Factory define when and how pipelines should be executed, such as scheduled intervals or event-based executions.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">9. Can you create custom activities in Azure Data Factory?</h2>
    <p>Yes, custom activities can be created using Azure Batch to run user-defined code or scripts as part of a pipeline.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">10. How does Azure Data Factory handle large data volumes?</h2>
    <p>Azure Data Factory handles large data volumes by utilizing parallel processing, partitioning, and data compression techniques to optimize data transfer and processing.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">11. What is the purpose of using the Data Lake Storage Gen2 with Azure Data Factory?</h2>
    <p>Data Lake Storage Gen2 is used with Azure Data Factory for scalable and secure data storage, enabling efficient data access and analytics across big data workloads.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">12. How do you manage version control in Azure Data Factory?</h2>
    <p>Version control in Azure Data Factory can be managed by using Git integration, allowing users to track changes, collaborate on development, and manage different versions of data factory components.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">13. What is a dataset in Azure Data Factory?</h2>
    <p>A dataset in Azure Data Factory represents the structure of data in a data store, serving as a pointer to the data and providing a way to define its schema.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">14. How can Azure Data Factory assist in ETL processes?</h2>
    <p>Azure Data Factory assists in ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes by orchestrating data movement, performing transformations, and loading data into various destinations.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">15. Can Azure Data Factory integrate with other Azure services?</h2>
    <p>Yes, Azure Data Factory can integrate with various Azure services, including Azure Blob Storage, Azure SQL Database, Azure Functions, and more for seamless data workflows.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">16. What are pipeline parameters in Azure Data Factory?</h2>
    <p>Pipeline parameters are variables defined within a pipeline that allow for dynamic configuration and customization of pipeline execution.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">17. How do you perform data validation in Azure Data Factory?</h2>
    <p>Data validation can be performed using the data flow features to check for anomalies or expected data formats before proceeding with the pipeline activities.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">18. What are the common use cases for Azure Data Factory?</h2>
    <p>Common use cases for Azure Data Factory include data migration, data integration from diverse sources, ETL processes, and data preparation for analytics and reporting.</p>
