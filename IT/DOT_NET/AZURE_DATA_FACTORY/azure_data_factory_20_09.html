</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">2. What types of Integration Runtimes does Azure Data Factory support?</h2>
    <p>Azure Data Factory supports three types of Integration Runtimes: Azure Integration Runtime, Self-hosted Integration Runtime, and Azure-SSIS Integration Runtime.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">3. How can you monitor the activities in Azure Data Factory?</h2>
    <p>You can monitor Azure Data Factory activities using the monitoring features in the Azure portal, which provide logs, metrics, and alerts for pipeline runs and activity status.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">4. Can you schedule Azure Data Factory pipelines to run at specific times?</h2>
    <p>Yes, Azure Data Factory allows you to schedule pipelines using triggers that can be set to run on specific schedules or in response to events.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">5. What is a linked service in Azure Data Factory?</h2>
    <p>A linked service in Azure Data Factory defines the connection information needed for Data Factory to connect to external data sources.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">6. How does Azure Data Factory handle large data volumes?</h2>
    <p>Azure Data Factory handles large data volumes by enabling parallel processing and scaling of Integration Runtimes, allowing efficient data movement and transformation.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">7. What is the role of parameters in Azure Data Factory pipelines?</h2>
    <p>Parameters in Azure Data Factory pipelines allow you to pass dynamic values at runtime, making pipelines more flexible and reusable for different scenarios.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">8. Can you integrate Azure Data Factory with Azure Machine Learning?</h2>
    <p>Yes, Azure Data Factory can be integrated with Azure Machine Learning to automate data preparation and model training processes as part of the data pipeline.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">9. What is the purpose of the "Copy Data" tool in Azure Data Factory?</h2>
    <p>The "Copy Data" tool in Azure Data Factory is a user-friendly interface that simplifies the process of copying data from source to destination with minimal configuration.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">10. How can you handle errors in Azure Data Factory?</h2>
    <p>You can handle errors in Azure Data Factory by using retry policies, configuring activity dependencies, and implementing error handling pathways within pipelines.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">11. What is the difference between an activity and a pipeline in Azure Data Factory?</h2>
    <p>An activity is a single unit of work performed in a pipeline, while a pipeline is a logical grouping of one or more activities that together perform a task.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">12. How can you test Azure Data Factory pipelines?</h2>
    <p>You can test Azure Data Factory pipelines by triggering them manually, inspecting the output and logs, and validating data transformations and movements.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">13. What are the best practices for designing Azure Data Factory pipelines?</h2>
    <p>Best practices include modular design, proper error handling, parameterization, logging, and using activities judiciously to avoid excessive complexity.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">14. Can Azure Data Factory perform data transformations?</h2>
    <p>Yes, Azure Data Factory can perform data transformations through data flows and various transformation activities like mapping and aggregating data.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">15. What are the limitations of Azure Data Factory?</h2>
    <p>Limitations of Azure Data Factory include restricted data movement per region, limitations on the size of datasets, and certain constraints on activities and execution time.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">

    <p>You can automate Azure Data Factory deployments using Azure DevOps, ARM templates, and PowerShell scripts to streamline CI/CD processes.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">17. What is a mapping data flow in Azure Data Factory?</h2>
    <p>A mapping data flow in Azure Data Factory is a data transformation feature that allows users to build complex data transformation logic using a visual interface.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">18. How does Azure Data Factory ensure data security?</h2>
    <p>Azure Data Factory ensures data security through network isolation, encryption in transit and at rest, and integration with Azure Active Directory for authentication.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">19. Can Azure Data Factory connect to REST APIs?</h2>
    <p>Yes, Azure Data Factory can connect to REST APIs as data sources or sinks by using the HTTP connector, allowing data integration from various web services.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">20. What is a debug run in Azure Data Factory?</h2>
    <p>A debug run in Azure Data Factory allows you to test your pipelines in a debug mode, where you can execute a pipeline and inspect data at various steps.</p>
