<h1>Azure Data Factory Q&A - Part 01</h1>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">1. What is Azure Data Factory?</h2>
    <p>Azure Data Factory (ADF) is a cloud-based data integration service that allows you to create, schedule, and orchestrate data workflows.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">2. What are the primary components of Azure Data Factory?</h2>
    <p>The primary components of Azure Data Factory are pipelines, activities, datasets, linked services, and triggers.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">3. What is a pipeline in Azure Data Factory?</h2>
    <p>A pipeline is a logical grouping of activities that together perform a task. It allows you to manage the execution of data workflows.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">4. What types of activities can you create in a pipeline?</h2>
    <p>Activities in a pipeline can include data movement activities, data transformation activities, and control activities, such as executing stored procedures.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">5. How does Azure Data Factory handle data transformation?</h2>
    <p>Azure Data Factory can handle data transformation using data flows, which allow you to visually design transformations without writing code.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">6. What is a linked service in Azure Data Factory?</h2>
    <p>A linked service defines a connection to a data store or compute resource, specifying the connection string and authentication method.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">7. How do you schedule pipelines in Azure Data Factory?</h2>
    <p>Pipelines can be scheduled using triggers, which can be time-based (scheduled) or event-based (based on the occurrence of an event).</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">8. Can Azure Data Factory integrate with other Azure services?</h2>
    <p>Yes, Azure Data Factory integrates with various Azure services, including Azure Blob Storage, Azure SQL Database, Azure Databricks, and Azure Machine Learning.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">9. What is the purpose of data flows in Azure Data Factory?</h2>
    <p>Data flows allow you to perform data transformations at scale in a visually designed interface, without needing to write any code.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">10. How does Azure Data Factory support hybrid data integration?</h2>
    <p>Azure Data Factory supports hybrid data integration by allowing you to connect to on-premises data sources through self-hosted integration runtimes.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">11. What is a self-hosted integration runtime in Azure Data Factory?</h2>
    <p>A self-hosted integration runtime allows you to connect to on-premises data sources and integrate them with Azure services securely.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">12. How can you monitor the performance of pipelines in Azure Data Factory?</h2>
    <p>You can monitor pipeline performance using the Azure portal, where you can view activity runs, trigger runs, and monitor data flow activity.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">13. What are parameters in Azure Data Factory, and how are they used?</h2>
    <p>Parameters allow you to pass dynamic values to pipelines and activities, enabling you to create reusable and flexible data workflows.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">14. Can you create custom activities in Azure Data Factory?</h2>
    <p>Yes, you can create custom activities in Azure Data Factory using Azure Batch to run custom code or executables on a managed cluster.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">15. How do you handle errors in Azure Data Factory?</h2>
    <p>You can handle errors in Azure Data Factory using try-catch patterns in pipelines and configuring retry policies for activities.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">16. What are triggers in Azure Data Factory?</h2>
    <p>Triggers are used to execute pipelines based on specific conditions, such as a scheduled time or an event occurring in a data source.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">17. How do you version control Azure Data Factory assets?</h2>
    <p>You can version control Azure Data Factory assets using Git integration, allowing you to track changes and collaborate with team members.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">18. What is the role of datasets in Azure Data Factory?</h2>
    <p>Datasets represent the data structures used in the activities of a pipeline, defining the schema and data format.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">19. How does Azure Data Factory support data movement?</h2>
    <p>Azure Data Factory supports data movement through copy activities that can transfer data between various data stores, both on-premises and in the cloud.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">20. What security features are available in Azure Data Factory?</h2>
    <p>Azure Data Factory offers security features such as role-based access control (RBAC), data encryption, and managed identities for secure connections to resources.</p>
