    <h2 class="question">3. How do you handle schema changes in Azure Data Factory?</h2>
    <p>Azure Data Factory allows users to manage schema changes through mapping configurations in Copy Activities and by using Data Flows to dynamically adapt to schema variations.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">4. What are pipelines in Azure Data Factory?</h2>
    <p>Pipelines in Azure Data Factory are logical containers that organize a sequence of activities, enabling the orchestration of data movement and transformation tasks.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">5. How does Azure Data Factory manage data quality?</h2>
    <p>Azure Data Factory manages data quality by enabling users to implement data validation rules, monitoring data flows, and integrating with tools like Azure Data Quality.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">6. What is an activity in Azure Data Factory?</h2>
    <p>An activity in Azure Data Factory is a unit of work performed in a pipeline, such as copying data, running a stored procedure, or transforming data.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">7. Can you use Azure Data Factory to move data from on-premises to the cloud?</h2>
    <p>Yes, Azure Data Factory can move data from on-premises systems to cloud data stores using the Self-hosted Integration Runtime.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">8. What is a linked service in Azure Data Factory?</h2>
    <p>A linked service in Azure Data Factory defines the connection information needed to connect to external data sources or services.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">9. How can you monitor the performance of Azure Data Factory pipelines?</h2>
    <p>You can monitor the performance of Azure Data Factory pipelines through the Azure portal, which provides monitoring dashboards, logs, and metrics for pipeline activities.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">10. What is a parameter in Azure Data Factory?</h2>
    <p>A parameter in Azure Data Factory is a configurable value that can be passed to pipelines, datasets, and activities to provide flexibility and reusability.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">11. How do you implement retry policies in Azure Data Factory?</h2>
    <p>Retry policies can be implemented in Azure Data Factory by configuring the settings for individual activities to specify the number of retries and the interval between attempts.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">12. Can Azure Data Factory integrate with Power BI?</h2>
    <p>Yes, Azure Data Factory can integrate with Power BI to prepare and transform data for reporting and visualization by loading the transformed data into Power BI datasets.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">13. What is the use of the If Condition activity in Azure Data Factory?</h2>
    <p>The If Condition activity allows you to implement branching logic in pipelines, enabling different paths of execution based on the evaluation of an expression.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">14. How can you secure sensitive information in Azure Data Factory?</h2>
    <p>Sensitive information can be secured in Azure Data Factory using Azure Key Vault to store secrets and connection strings securely, ensuring they are not hard-coded in pipelines.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">15. What are the best practices for designing Azure Data Factory pipelines?</h2>
    <p>Best practices for designing Azure Data Factory pipelines include modularizing activities, using parameters and variables, implementing error handling, and monitoring performance regularly.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">16. Can Azure Data Factory run on a schedule?</h2>
    <p>Yes, Azure Data Factory pipelines can be scheduled to run at specific times or intervals using triggers to automate data integration workflows.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">17. What is a schema mapping in Azure Data Factory?</h2>
    <p>A schema mapping in Azure Data Factory defines how the source data structure corresponds to the destination data structure during data movement or transformation.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">18. How can Azure Data Factory handle large volumes of data?</h2>
    <p>Azure Data Factory can handle large volumes of data by leveraging parallel processing, partitioning strategies, and optimized data flows to ensure efficient data movement and transformation.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">19. What is the difference between a pipeline and a data flow in Azure Data Factory?</h2>
    <p>A pipeline in Azure Data Factory orchestrates a sequence of activities, while a data flow is specifically designed for data transformation, providing a graphical interface for defining data transformation logic.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">20. How does Azure Data Factory support continuous integration and deployment?</h2>
    <p>Azure Data Factory supports continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) by enabling users to export and import ARM templates for pipelines and activities, allowing for version control and automated deployments.</p>
