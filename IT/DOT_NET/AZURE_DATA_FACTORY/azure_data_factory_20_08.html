<h1>Azure Data Factory Q&A - Part 08</h1>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">1. What is a dataset in Azure Data Factory?</h2>
    <p>A dataset in Azure Data Factory represents the structure of data in a data store, which can be used as inputs or outputs in data flows and pipelines.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">2. How does Azure Data Factory handle data lineage?</h2>
    <p>Azure Data Factory provides data lineage capabilities that allow users to track data transformations and movements across the pipeline, helping to understand data flow.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">3. What is the difference between a copy activity and a data flow activity in Azure Data Factory?</h2>
    <p>A copy activity is used to copy data from one source to another, while a data flow activity is used for transforming data at scale using visual design tools.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">4. Can you use Azure Data Factory to move data between on-premises and cloud data sources?</h2>
    <p>Yes, Azure Data Factory supports moving data between on-premises and cloud data sources using the Self-hosted Integration Runtime.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">5. What is the purpose of using triggers in Azure Data Factory?</h2>
    <p>Triggers in Azure Data Factory automate the execution of pipelines based on specified schedules or events, enabling continuous data integration workflows.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">6. How do you create a data pipeline in Azure Data Factory?</h2>
    <p>You can create a data pipeline in Azure Data Factory using the Azure portal, where you can define activities, set parameters, and link datasets as needed.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">7. What are the different types of activities supported in Azure Data Factory?</h2>
    <p>Azure Data Factory supports various activity types, including data movement, data transformation, control flow, and external activities (like Azure Databricks or Azure Functions).</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">8. Can Azure Data Factory connect to third-party data sources?</h2>
    <p>Yes, Azure Data Factory can connect to numerous third-party data sources through the use of connectors, which facilitate data integration from various platforms.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">9. What is an integration runtime in Azure Data Factory?</h2>
    <p>The Integration Runtime in Azure Data Factory provides the necessary compute environment for data movement and transformation activities, enabling connectivity to data sources.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">10. How can you parameterize your Azure Data Factory pipelines?</h2>
    <p>You can parameterize Azure Data Factory pipelines by defining parameters at the pipeline level, allowing dynamic values to be passed at runtime for activities.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">11. What is the use of the 'ForEach' activity in Azure Data Factory?</h2>
    <p>The 'ForEach' activity in Azure Data Factory is used to iterate over a collection of items and execute specified activities for each item in the collection.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">12. Can Azure Data Factory be used for ETL processes?</h2>
    <p>Yes, Azure Data Factory is widely used for ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes, facilitating data integration, transformation, and loading into data destinations.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">13. How does Azure Data Factory support data governance?</h2>
    <p>Azure Data Factory supports data governance through features like data lineage tracking, auditing, and integration with Azure Purview for cataloging data assets.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">14. What are data flows in Azure Data Factory?</h2>
    <p>Data flows in Azure Data Factory allow users to visually design data transformations and data manipulation processes without writing code, using a graphical interface.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">15. What types of data stores can Azure Data Factory connect to?</h2>
    <p>Azure Data Factory can connect to a variety of data stores, including Azure Blob Storage, Azure SQL Database, Azure Data Lake Storage, and many third-party sources.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">16. How can you optimize performance in Azure Data Factory?</h2>
    <p>Performance can be optimized in Azure Data Factory by using parallel copies, tuning the size of the Integration Runtime, and optimizing data flows to reduce transformation time.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">17. What is the significance of activity dependencies in Azure Data Factory?</h2>
    <p>Activity dependencies in Azure Data Factory determine the order of execution for activities within a pipeline, allowing control over when certain activities run based on the success or failure of others.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">18. Can Azure Data Factory perform data validation?</h2>
    <p>Yes, Azure Data Factory can perform data validation through data flows, where users can add validation rules and logic to ensure data quality before further processing.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">19. How do you share Azure Data Factory resources between different Azure subscriptions?</h2>
    <p>You can share Azure Data Factory resources between different Azure subscriptions by using Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates for deployment and sharing of pipelines and datasets.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">20. What is the difference between the Azure Data Factory Standard and Premium tiers?</h2>
    <p>The Azure Data Factory Premium tier offers additional features such as enhanced data flow capabilities, unlimited Data Movement, and more extensive support for on-premises data integration compared to the Standard tier.</p>
