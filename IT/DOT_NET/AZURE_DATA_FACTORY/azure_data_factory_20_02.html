<h1>Azure Data Factory Q&A - Part 02</h1>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">1. What is the primary purpose of Azure Data Factory?</h2>
    <p>The primary purpose of Azure Data Factory is to facilitate data integration, enabling the movement and transformation of data from various sources to destinations.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">2. How does Azure Data Factory support ETL processes?</h2>
    <p>Azure Data Factory supports ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes by allowing users to extract data from various sources, transform it using data flows or mapping data transformations, and load it into target destinations.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">3. Can Azure Data Factory orchestrate data workflows across multiple regions?</h2>
    <p>Yes, Azure Data Factory can orchestrate data workflows across multiple Azure regions, allowing for global data integration scenarios.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">4. What is the purpose of the Azure Data Factory management API?</h2>
    <p>The Azure Data Factory management API allows you to programmatically manage ADF resources, such as pipelines, datasets, and triggers, enabling automation and integration with other applications.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">5. How do you handle schema drift in Azure Data Factory?</h2>
    <p>Schema drift can be managed in Azure Data Factory by using schema mapping in data flows, allowing you to handle changes in data structure without breaking the pipeline.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">6. What types of data sources can Azure Data Factory connect to?</h2>
    <p>Azure Data Factory can connect to a wide variety of data sources, including Azure services, on-premises databases, REST APIs, file systems, and third-party cloud services.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">7. What is the significance of integration runtimes in Azure Data Factory?</h2>
    <p>Integration runtimes are critical in Azure Data Factory as they provide the infrastructure needed to move and transform data, whether in the cloud or on-premises.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">8. How can you implement data lineage in Azure Data Factory?</h2>
    <p>Data lineage can be implemented in Azure Data Factory using the built-in monitoring features that track data movements and transformations throughout the pipelines.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">9. What role do activity dependencies play in Azure Data Factory?</h2>
    <p>Activity dependencies define the order in which activities run in a pipeline, allowing you to manage complex workflows by specifying conditions for activity execution.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">10. Can Azure Data Factory integrate with Azure Machine Learning?</h2>
    <p>Yes, Azure Data Factory can integrate with Azure Machine Learning to automate the deployment and scoring of machine learning models as part of data workflows.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">11. What is a lookup activity in Azure Data Factory?</h2>
    <p>A lookup activity retrieves a dataset from a data store, which can be used in subsequent activities for validation or conditional processing.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">12. How do you secure data in transit with Azure Data Factory?</h2>
    <p>Data in transit can be secured in Azure Data Factory by using secure connections and protocols, such as HTTPS and VPNs, along with Azure's encryption features.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">13. What is the difference between a copy activity and a data flow in Azure Data Factory?</h2>
    <p>A copy activity is used to copy data from a source to a destination without transformation, while a data flow allows for data transformation during the movement process.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">14. Can you run Azure Data Factory pipelines on-demand?</h2>
    <p>Yes, you can trigger Azure Data Factory pipelines on-demand using the Azure portal, REST API, or Azure CLI, in addition to scheduled and event-based triggers.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">15. How does Azure Data Factory manage cost?</h2>
    <p>Azure Data Factory manages cost by allowing you to pay only for the resources you consume, such as data movement and transformation activities, and by providing cost analysis tools in the Azure portal.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">16. What are the different types of triggers available in Azure Data Factory?</h2>
    <p>Azure Data Factory supports several trigger types, including scheduled triggers (time-based) and event-based triggers (triggered by events in Azure Blob Storage or other services).</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">17. How can you optimize performance in Azure Data Factory?</h2>
    <p>Performance in Azure Data Factory can be optimized by using parallel processing, batching, and optimizing the configuration of data flows and copy activities.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">18. What monitoring tools are available for Azure Data Factory?</h2>
    <p>Azure Data Factory provides monitoring tools through the Azure portal, allowing you to track pipeline runs, activity runs, and view detailed logs and metrics.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">19. How do you configure alerts for Azure Data Factory?</h2>
    <p>You can configure alerts in Azure Data Factory using Azure Monitor to set up alerts based on metrics or logs for pipeline failures and performance issues.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">20. Can you create custom activities using Azure Functions in Azure Data Factory?</h2>
    <p>Yes, you can create custom activities in Azure Data Factory that invoke Azure Functions, allowing you to run custom code as part of your data workflows.</p>
