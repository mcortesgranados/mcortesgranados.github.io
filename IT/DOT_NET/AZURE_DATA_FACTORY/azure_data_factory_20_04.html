<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">1. What is a Copy Activity in Azure Data Factory?</h2>
    <p>The Copy Activity in Azure Data Factory is used to copy data from a source data store to a destination data store, supporting various data formats and transformation options.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">2. How does Azure Data Factory integrate with Azure Machine Learning?</h2>
    <p>Azure Data Factory can integrate with Azure Machine Learning by using pipeline activities to invoke machine learning models for data predictions and transformations.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">3. Can you use Azure Data Factory with serverless SQL pools?</h2>
    <p>Yes, Azure Data Factory can integrate with serverless SQL pools in Azure Synapse Analytics for data querying and transformation tasks.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">4. What is the role of the Self-hosted Integration Runtime?</h2>
    <p>The Self-hosted Integration Runtime allows Azure Data Factory to securely access on-premises data sources and data stores for hybrid data integration scenarios.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">5. How can you schedule data movements in Azure Data Factory?</h2>
    <p>Data movements can be scheduled in Azure Data Factory using triggers, which can be time-based or event-based, to automatically initiate pipeline runs.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">6. What are the different types of activities available in Azure Data Factory?</h2>
    <p>Azure Data Factory provides various types of activities, including data movement activities (Copy), data transformation activities (Data Flow), control activities (If Condition, ForEach), and external activities (Web, Azure Functions).</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">7. Can Azure Data Factory be used to orchestrate data workflows?</h2>
