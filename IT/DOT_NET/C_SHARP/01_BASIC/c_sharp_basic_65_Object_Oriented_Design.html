    <h1>C# Object-Oriented Design (OOD)</h1>
    <p>Object-Oriented Design (OOD) is a programming paradigm that revolves around the concept of "objects"—instances of classes that represent real-world entities. In C#, OOD principles help design systems that are modular, reusable, and maintainable.</p>

    <h2>1. Core Principles of Object-Oriented Design</h2>
    <p>There are four main principles of Object-Oriented Design, often referred to as SOLID principles:</p>
    
    <h3>1.1 Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)</h3>
    <p>A class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should have only one responsibility or job. This makes the class easier to maintain and test.</p>
    <pre><code>
class ReportGenerator
{
    public void GenerateReport()
    {
        // Responsibility: Generating a report
    }
    
    public void PrintReport()
    {
        // Responsibility: Printing a report
    }
}
    </code></pre>
    <p>In this example, the class `ReportGenerator` violates the SRP because it handles both generating and printing reports. Each responsibility should be handled by a separate class.</p>
    
    <h3>1.2 Open/Closed Principle (OCP)</h3>
    <p>Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification. This means you can extend a class's behavior without modifying its existing code.</p>
    <pre><code>
public abstract class Shape
{
    public abstract double GetArea();
}

public class Circle : Shape
{
    public double Radius { get; set; }

    public override double GetArea()
    {
        return Math.PI * Radius * Radius;
    }
}

public class Square : Shape
{
    public double Side { get; set; }

    public override double GetArea()
    {
        return Side * Side;
    }
}
    </code></pre>
    <p>In this example, the `Shape` class is open for extension (new shapes can be added), but the existing `Circle` and `Square` classes are closed for modification.</p>
    
    <h3>1.3 Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)</h3>
    <p>Derived classes must be substitutable for their base classes without altering the correctness of the program.</p>
    <pre><code>
public class Bird
{
    public virtual void Fly() { }
}

public class Penguin : Bird
{
    public override void Fly()
    {
        throw new InvalidOperationException("Penguins can't fly!");
    }
}
    </code></pre>
    <p>In this case, the `Penguin` class violates LSP because substituting a `Penguin` for a `Bird` results in an exception. The solution would be to avoid inheritance where the behavior cannot be maintained.</p>
    
    <h3>1.4 Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)</h3>
    <p>Clients should not be forced to implement interfaces they do not use. Split large interfaces into smaller, more specific ones.</p>
    <pre><code>
public interface IPrinter
{
    void Print();
    void Scan(); // Not all printers can scan, violating ISP
}

public interface IPrinterBasic
{
    void Print();
}

public interface IScanner
{
    void Scan();
}
    </code></pre>
    <p>In this example, the `IPrinter` interface violates ISP because it forces the implementation of scanning functionality in printers that may not support it. Instead, smaller interfaces like `IPrinterBasic` and `IScanner` are better.</p>

    <h3>1.5 Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)</h3>
    <p>High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions. Also, abstractions should not depend on details, but details should depend on abstractions.</p>
    <pre><code>
public interface IMessageSender
{
    void SendMessage(string message);
}

public class EmailSender : IMessageSender
{
    public void SendMessage(string message)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Email sent: " + message);
    }
}

public class Notification
{
    private readonly IMessageSender _messageSender;

    public Notification(IMessageSender messageSender)
    {
        _messageSender = messageSender;
    }

    public void Send(string message)
    {
        _messageSender.SendMessage(message);
    }
}
    </code></pre>
    <p>In this example, the `Notification` class depends on the `IMessageSender` interface, not the `EmailSender` class directly, which adheres to DIP by depending on abstractions rather than concrete implementations.</p>

    <h2>2. Key Concepts in Object-Oriented Design</h2>
    <h3>2.1 Encapsulation</h3>
    <p>Encapsulation involves hiding the internal state of an object and only exposing necessary parts through methods and properties. This prevents unauthorized access to the object’s data.</p>

    <h3>2.2 Inheritance</h3>
    <p>Inheritance allows you to define a new class based on an existing class, promoting code reuse and the creation of a class hierarchy.</p>

    <h3>2.3 Polymorphism</h3>
    <p>Polymorphism allows methods in different derived classes to have different implementations while sharing the same name.</p>

    <h3>2.4 Abstraction</h3>
    <p>Abstraction involves creating abstract classes or interfaces that represent general concepts, allowing specific implementations in derived classes.</p>

    <h2>3. Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Object-Oriented Design in C# promotes creating modular, maintainable, and reusable code by adhering to SOLID principles and object-oriented concepts like encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction. These principles help design better software systems that are scalable and easier to maintain.</p>
