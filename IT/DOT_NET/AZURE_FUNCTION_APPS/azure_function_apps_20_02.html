<h1>Azure Function Apps Q&A - Part 02</h1>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">1. What is the purpose of Azure Function Apps?</h2>
    <p>Azure Function Apps enable you to run small pieces of code, or functions, in the cloud without worrying about the underlying infrastructure, perfect for event-driven applications.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">2. Can Azure Functions be used for real-time data processing?</h2>
    <p>Yes, Azure Functions can be triggered by real-time events, such as changes in a database or messages in a queue, making them suitable for real-time data processing.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">3. How are Azure Functions deployed in different environments?</h2>
    <p>Azure Functions can be deployed to different environments using slots (e.g., staging, production) or using CI/CD pipelines to manage deployments to Azure.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">4. What is a Function App?</h2>
    <p>A Function App is a container for one or more Azure Functions, providing a way to organize and manage functions and their configuration settings.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">5. What is the role of the Azure Functions runtime?</h2>
    <p>The Azure Functions runtime is responsible for executing the functions, managing scaling, and handling the triggering of functions based on events.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">6. Can Azure Functions integrate with third-party APIs?</h2>
    <p>Yes, Azure Functions can call and interact with third-party APIs using HTTP requests, enabling integration with various services.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">7. What is the importance of triggers in Azure Functions?</h2>
    <p>Triggers define how a function is invoked. They can be based on events from various sources, enabling automatic execution of the function when certain conditions are met.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">8. What is a timeout in Azure Functions?</h2>
    <p>A timeout is a duration that limits how long a function can run. In the Consumption Plan, the default timeout is 5 minutes, while in Premium and Dedicated Plans, it can be configured up to 60 minutes.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">9. How do Azure Functions handle dependencies?</h2>
    <p>Dependencies can be managed using a package manager (like npm for JavaScript, pip for Python) and are included in the function's deployment package.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">10. What is the significance of application settings in Azure Functions?</h2>
    <p>Application settings allow you to store configuration values and secrets, which can be accessed securely in your function code without hardcoding sensitive information.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">11. Can Azure Functions be monitored for performance and usage?</h2>
    <p>Yes, Azure Functions can be monitored using Azure Application Insights to track performance, failures, and usage metrics.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">12. What is the difference between stateless and stateful functions?</h2>
    <p>Stateless functions do not retain any state information between executions, while stateful functions (using Durable Functions) can maintain state across multiple function calls.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">13. Can Azure Functions be executed in parallel?</h2>
    <p>Yes, Azure Functions can be executed in parallel, which allows for handling multiple events simultaneously based on the triggers and scaling settings.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">14. What is the Azure Functions premium plan?</h2>
    <p>The Azure Functions Premium Plan provides enhanced performance, VNET integration, unlimited execution duration, and more powerful scaling options compared to the Consumption Plan.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">15. How do I secure Azure Function Apps?</h2>
    <p>Azure Function Apps can be secured using Azure Active Directory, API keys, or other authentication methods to control access to the functions.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">16. What is an HTTP trigger in Azure Functions?</h2>
    <p>An HTTP trigger allows you to invoke a function via an HTTP request, making it possible to create RESTful APIs or respond to webhooks.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">17. Can Azure Functions run on a dedicated App Service plan?</h2>
    <p>Yes, Azure Functions can be hosted on a dedicated App Service plan, allowing for more predictable pricing and performance characteristics.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">18. How do Azure Functions handle scaling?</h2>
    <p>Azure Functions automatically scale based on demand, creating new instances of functions as needed to handle increased workloads.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">19. What is the maximum size for an Azure Function package?</h2>
    <p>The maximum size for an Azure Function package is 500 MB when deployed using the ZIP deploy method.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">20. Can Azure Functions access Azure Blob Storage?</h2>
    <p>Yes, Azure Functions can easily access Azure Blob Storage for reading or writing data, often using input and output bindings for seamless integration.</p>
