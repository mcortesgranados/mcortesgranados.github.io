<h1>Azure Function Apps Q&A - Part 06</h1>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">1. How do Azure Functions handle concurrency?</h2>
    <p>Azure Functions handle concurrency by scaling out to multiple instances based on demand, allowing multiple function executions to occur simultaneously.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">2. Can Azure Functions write logs?</h2>
    <p>Yes, Azure Functions can write logs using the built-in logging features provided by Azure Application Insights or the context.log object in the function code.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">3. How can I configure CORS for Azure Functions?</h2>
    <p>You can configure CORS for Azure Functions by adding allowed origins in the "CORS" section of your Function App settings in the Azure Portal.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">4. What is the maximum execution timeout for Azure Functions?</h2>
    <p>The maximum execution timeout for Azure Functions in the Consumption Plan is 5 minutes, while the Premium and Dedicated Plans can have a longer timeout set up to 60 minutes.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">5. Can I use third-party libraries in Azure Functions?</h2>
    <p>Yes, you can use third-party libraries in Azure Functions by including them in your project or using dependency management tools relevant to your programming language.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">6. What triggers can be used for event-driven architecture in Azure Functions?</h2>
    <p>Triggers for event-driven architecture in Azure Functions include HTTP triggers, Event Grid triggers, Service Bus triggers, and Timer triggers.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">7. How can I set up a timer trigger for Azure Functions?</h2>
    <p>A timer trigger can be set up by specifying a CRON expression in the function.json file or directly in the function code to define the execution schedule.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">8. Can Azure Functions work with Docker containers?</h2>
    <p>Yes, Azure Functions can run in Docker containers, allowing you to package your functions along with their dependencies and deploy them in a containerized environment.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">9. What is the role of the "host.json" file in Azure Functions?</h2>
    <p>The "host.json" file is used to configure global settings for your function app, such as logging, function timeouts, and connection settings for bindings.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">10. How can I trigger Azure Functions from an Azure Event Grid event?</h2>
    <p>You can trigger Azure Functions from an Azure Event Grid event by creating an Event Grid subscription that points to your function's endpoint URL.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">11. What is the difference between HTTP and Queue triggers in Azure Functions?</h2>
    <p>HTTP triggers respond to incoming HTTP requests, while Queue triggers are activated by messages placed in Azure Storage Queues or Service Bus queues.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">12. Can I monitor function execution costs in Azure Functions?</h2>
    <p>Yes, you can monitor execution costs in Azure Functions through the Azure Portal, which provides insights into the usage and associated costs of your function app.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">13. How do I handle API rate limiting in Azure Functions?</h2>
    <p>API rate limiting can be managed by implementing logic in your function code to check the rate of requests and throttle or queue additional requests as needed.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">14. Can Azure Functions send notifications?</h2>
    <p>Yes, Azure Functions can send notifications through various services, such as Azure Notification Hubs, Twilio for SMS, or using email services like SendGrid.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">15. What is an output binding in Azure Functions?</h2>
    <p>An output binding is a way to send data from an Azure Function to an external service, like a database or messaging queue, without needing additional code.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">16. How can I manage configuration settings for Azure Functions?</h2>
    <p>Configuration settings can be managed through the Azure Portal by using the Application Settings feature of the Function App to store key-value pairs.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">17. How do I create a Function App using Azure CLI?</h2>
    <p>You can create a Function App using Azure CLI with the command <code>az functionapp create --name <your_function_name> --resource-group <your_resource_group> --runtime <runtime_type></code>.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">18. Can I deploy Azure Functions from a GitHub repository?</h2>
    <p>Yes, you can deploy Azure Functions directly from a GitHub repository using the Azure Functions deployment center or by configuring a CI/CD pipeline.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">19. What is the purpose of the Azure Functions Core Tools?</h2>
    <p>Azure Functions Core Tools provide a local development environment to create, debug, and test Azure Functions on your local machine before deploying to Azure.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">20. How do I enable custom logging for Azure Functions?</h2>
    <p>You can enable custom logging in Azure Functions by configuring Application Insights or using logging libraries like Serilog or NLog within your function code.</p>
</div>
