<h1>Azure Function Apps Q&A - Part 08</h1>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">1. What are Durable Functions?</h2>
    <p>Durable Functions are an extension of Azure Functions that enable writing stateful functions in a serverless compute environment, allowing for complex workflows and long-running operations.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">2. How can I use Azure Functions for real-time data processing?</h2>
    <p>You can use Azure Functions for real-time data processing by utilizing triggers like Event Hubs or Service Bus to process streaming data as it arrives.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">3. Can Azure Functions integrate with Azure Cognitive Services?</h2>
    <p>Yes, Azure Functions can integrate with Azure Cognitive Services to process images, analyze text, and perform other cognitive tasks using the respective APIs.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">4. How do I implement versioning for Azure Functions?</h2>
    <p>You can implement versioning for Azure Functions by deploying multiple versions of a function app or by using different routes in your function URLs.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">5. What is the Azure Functions Premium Plan?</h2>
    <p>The Azure Functions Premium Plan provides additional features such as VNET integration, unlimited execution duration, and enhanced performance, compared to the Consumption Plan.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">6. How do I handle secrets in Azure Functions?</h2>
    <p>You can handle secrets in Azure Functions by using Azure Key Vault to securely store sensitive information and access it in your function code.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">7. What are the supported authentication methods for Azure Functions?</h2>
    <p>Azure Functions support various authentication methods, including Azure Active Directory, social logins (like Google and Facebook), and API keys.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">8. How do I use dependency injection in Azure Functions?</h2>
    <p>You can use dependency injection in Azure Functions by configuring a startup class and using the built-in Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection library.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">9. Can I run Azure Functions on-premises?</h2>
    <p>Yes, you can run Azure Functions on-premises using Azure Functions Runtime, which allows for a local development and production environment.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">10. What is the maximum number of concurrent executions for Azure Functions?</h2>
    <p>The maximum number of concurrent executions depends on the hosting plan; in the Consumption Plan, the default limit is 200 concurrent executions per function app.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">11. How can I manage Azure Function App settings through the Azure CLI?</h2>
    <p>You can manage Azure Function App settings using the Azure CLI by utilizing the <code>az functionapp config appsettings set</code> command to add or update settings.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">12. What are the main differences between Functions and Web Jobs?</h2>
    <p>Azure Functions are serverless, event-driven, and support a wide range of triggers and bindings, while Web Jobs are designed for background processing within an App Service environment.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">13. Can I use Azure Functions with SQL databases?</h2>
    <p>Yes, Azure Functions can interact with SQL databases using ADO.NET, Entity Framework, or other data access technologies, and they can also use bindings for easier integration.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">14. How can I implement health checks for Azure Functions?</h2>
    <p>You can implement health checks for Azure Functions by creating an HTTP-triggered function that returns a health status, and configuring Azure Monitor to check this endpoint.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">15. What types of storage options can Azure Functions work with?</h2>
    <p>Azure Functions can work with various storage options, including Azure Blob Storage, Azure Table Storage, Azure Cosmos DB, and Azure SQL Database.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">16. Can Azure Functions handle large files?</h2>
    <p>Azure Functions can handle large files, but it is recommended to use Azure Blob Storage for uploading and processing large files to avoid execution time limits.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">17. How do I enable Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) in Azure Functions?</h2>
    <p>You can enable CORS in Azure Functions by configuring the allowed origins in the Azure Portal under the CORS settings for your Function App.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">18. What is the importance of the "function.json" file?</h2>
    <p>The "function.json" file is crucial as it defines the function's bindings, input and output, and other configuration settings for the Azure Functions runtime.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">19. Can I trigger Azure Functions from Azure Logic Apps?</h2>
    <p>Yes, you can trigger Azure Functions from Azure Logic Apps by using the HTTP action in Logic Apps to call the function's endpoint.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">20. How do I monitor the performance of Azure Functions?</h2>
    <p>You can monitor the performance of Azure Functions using Azure Application Insights, which provides telemetry data, logging, and performance metrics.</p>
