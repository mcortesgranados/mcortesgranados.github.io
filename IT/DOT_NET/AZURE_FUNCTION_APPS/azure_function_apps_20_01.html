<h1>Azure Function Apps Q&A - Part 01</h1>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">1. What are Azure Function Apps?</h2>
    <p>Azure Function Apps are a serverless compute service that allows you to run event-driven code without managing infrastructure.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">2. What programming languages are supported by Azure Functions?</h2>
    <p>Azure Functions support multiple languages including C#, Java, JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, and PowerShell.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">3. How does billing work for Azure Function Apps?</h2>
    <p>Billing is based on a consumption model where you pay only for the resources consumed during execution, such as the number of executions and execution time.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">4. What is the difference between Azure Functions and Azure Logic Apps?</h2>
    <p>Azure Functions are code-based, allowing for custom logic and handling complex operations, while Azure Logic Apps are workflow-based and designed for integrating services and automating tasks.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">5. Can Azure Function Apps be triggered by HTTP requests?</h2>
    <p>Yes, Azure Function Apps can be triggered by HTTP requests, making it possible to create RESTful APIs.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">6. What is the maximum execution time for an Azure Function?</h2>
    <p>The maximum execution time for a function in a Consumption Plan is 5 minutes, while Premium and Dedicated Plans can run for up to 60 minutes.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">7. How can I deploy Azure Functions?</h2>
    <p>You can deploy Azure Functions using Azure Portal, Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, Azure CLI, or CI/CD tools like Azure DevOps.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">8. What are Durable Functions?</h2>
    <p>Durable Functions are an extension of Azure Functions that allow you to write stateful functions in a serverless environment, enabling long-running workflows.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">9. How can I monitor Azure Function Apps?</h2>
    <p>You can monitor Azure Function Apps using Azure Application Insights, which provides telemetry and insights into function performance and failures.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">10. What are input and output bindings in Azure Functions?</h2>
    <p>Bindings are a way to declaratively connect to data sources. Input bindings retrieve data, while output bindings send data to other services like databases or storage accounts.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">11. Can Azure Functions access other Azure services?</h2>
    <p>Yes, Azure Functions can easily access other Azure services like Azure Storage, Azure SQL Database, Cosmos DB, and more using connection strings or managed identities.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">12. What is the Azure Functions Core Tools?</h2>
    <p>Azure Functions Core Tools allow you to develop, test, and deploy Azure Functions from the command line or locally on your machine.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">13. How do I handle errors in Azure Functions?</h2>
    <p>You can handle errors in Azure Functions by using try-catch blocks, setting up error-handling middleware, or using the Application Insights to log and monitor exceptions.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">14. What triggers are available in Azure Functions?</h2>
    <p>Available triggers include HTTP, timer, blob storage, queue storage, Service Bus, Event Grid, and many more.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">15. How do I scale Azure Function Apps?</h2>
    <p>Azure Functions automatically scale based on demand. In a Consumption Plan, instances are created as needed, while in Premium or Dedicated Plans, you can configure scaling settings.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">16. What is the difference between Consumption Plan and Premium Plan?</h2>
    <p>The Consumption Plan automatically scales and charges based on usage, while the Premium Plan offers enhanced performance, longer execution times, and additional features like VNET integration.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">17. Can I use Visual Studio to develop Azure Functions?</h2>
    <p>Yes, Visual Studio provides integrated support for developing Azure Functions, including templates for creating new functions and deploying them to Azure.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">18. What are the security options available for Azure Function Apps?</h2>
    <p>You can secure Azure Function Apps using Azure Active Directory, function-level authorization, API keys, and managed identities for accessing other Azure resources securely.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">19. Can Azure Function Apps run on a local development environment?</h2>
    <p>Yes, you can run Azure Functions locally using the Azure Functions Core Tools for development and testing before deploying to Azure.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">20. How can I update Azure Functions after deployment?</h2>
    <p>You can update Azure Functions by redeploying your code using your chosen deployment method, whether through Azure Portal, Visual Studio, or CI/CD pipelines.</p>
