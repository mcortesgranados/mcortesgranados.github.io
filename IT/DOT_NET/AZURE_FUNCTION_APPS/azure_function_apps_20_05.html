</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">2. What is the difference between Durable Functions and regular Azure Functions?</h2>
    <p>Durable Functions are designed for long-running workflows and manage state automatically, while regular Azure Functions are stateless and execute independently.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">3. Can I set up a custom domain for my Azure Functions?</h2>
    <p>Yes, you can configure a custom domain for your Azure Functions by using Azure API Management or App Service for a more seamless experience.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">4. How do I implement versioning in Azure Functions?</h2>
    <p>You can implement versioning by using different routes for function URLs or by deploying multiple function apps for different versions.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">5. Can I use Azure Functions to process data in real-time?</h2>
    <p>Yes, Azure Functions can process data in real-time by responding to events from services like Azure Event Grid, Service Bus, or IoT Hub.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">6. How can I automate deployments for Azure Functions?</h2>
    <p>You can automate deployments using Azure DevOps or GitHub Actions, allowing for CI/CD pipelines that deploy functions on code changes.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">7. What is the significance of the Azure Functions Premium Plan?</h2>
    <p>The Premium Plan provides additional features like VNET integration, higher performance, and support for unlimited execution duration, making it suitable for enterprise applications.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">8. How can I manage secrets in Azure Functions?</h2>
    <p>You can manage secrets using Azure Key Vault to securely store sensitive information and access it from your Azure Functions securely.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">9. What types of triggers are available in Azure Functions?</h2>
    <p>Triggers in Azure Functions include HTTP triggers, Timer triggers, Queue triggers, Event Hub triggers, Service Bus triggers, and Blob triggers, among others.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">10. How do I handle dependencies in Azure Functions?</h2>
    <p>You can handle dependencies by including them in your function project (e.g., using a requirements.txt file for Python or package.json for Node.js).</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">11. Can Azure Functions return HTTP responses?</h2>
    <p>Yes, Azure Functions can return HTTP responses, making them suitable for creating RESTful APIs.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">12. How do I scale Azure Functions automatically?</h2>
    <p>Azure Functions automatically scale based on demand in the Consumption Plan, where instances are created and removed based on incoming requests.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">13. What is a Blob trigger in Azure Functions?</h2>
    <p>A Blob trigger allows an Azure Function to execute when a new blob is created or updated in a specified Azure Storage container.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">14. Can I run Azure Functions on a Linux environment?</h2>
    <p>Yes, Azure Functions can run on Linux environments, supporting various languages and runtimes that are compatible with Linux.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">15. How do I create an Azure Function in the Azure Portal?</h2>
    <p>You can create an Azure Function in the Azure Portal by navigating to "Create a resource," selecting "Function App," and following the setup wizard.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">16. How can I trigger Azure Functions from an Azure Logic App?</h2>
    <p>You can trigger Azure Functions from an Azure Logic App by using the "HTTP" action or "Azure Function" connector within the Logic App workflow.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">17. What are the pricing models available for Azure Functions?</h2>
