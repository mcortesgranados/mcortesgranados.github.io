<h1>Azure Event Grid Q&A - Part 08</h1>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">1. What types of events can Azure Event Grid handle?</h2>
    <p>Azure Event Grid can handle a variety of events, including custom events, system events from Azure services, and events from partner services.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">2. How does Azure Event Grid support event filtering?</h2>
    <p>Azure Event Grid supports event filtering through event subscription filters, allowing you to specify which events to send to subscribers based on specific criteria.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">3. What is the difference between event routing and event handling?</h2>
    <p>Event routing refers to directing events to specific subscribers based on rules, while event handling is the actual processing of those events by the subscriber.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">4. How can you secure events in Azure Event Grid?</h2>
    <p>You can secure events in Azure Event Grid using authentication mechanisms such as shared access signatures (SAS), OAuth, or Azure Active Directory.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">5. Can Azure Event Grid integrate with Azure Logic Apps?</h2>
    <p>Yes, Azure Event Grid can integrate with Azure Logic Apps, allowing you to create workflows that respond to events from Azure services and custom sources.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">6. What is a system topic in Azure Event Grid?</h2>
    <p>A system topic is a predefined topic in Azure Event Grid that is automatically created for certain Azure services to publish events.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">7. How do you enable retry policies for event subscriptions?</h2>
    <p>Retry policies can be configured in the event subscription settings, allowing you to specify the number of retries and the time interval between them.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">8. What is the purpose of the Azure Event Grid schema?</h2>
    <p>The Azure Event Grid schema defines the structure of events, ensuring that publishers and subscribers can understand and process events consistently.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">9. How can you test Azure Event Grid event delivery?</h2>
    <p>You can test Azure Event Grid event delivery using tools like Azure CLI, Azure Portal, or by publishing events directly to a topic and checking the event handlers.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">10. What happens if an event handler does not acknowledge an event?</h2>
    <p>If an event handler does not acknowledge an event, Azure Event Grid will attempt to resend the event based on the configured retry policy.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">11. Can you create multiple subscriptions for the same event in Azure Event Grid?</h2>
    <p>Yes, you can create multiple subscriptions for the same event, allowing different subscribers to process the same event independently.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">12. How does Azure Event Grid handle events from external sources?</h2>
    <p>Azure Event Grid can handle events from external sources through webhooks, allowing any HTTP endpoint to receive events by publishing to a custom topic.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">13. What role does Azure Monitor play with Azure Event Grid?</h2>
    <p>Azure Monitor plays a crucial role by providing insights, metrics, and logging capabilities to track the performance and health of Azure Event Grid services.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">14. Can Azure Event Grid process events in a guaranteed order?</h2>
    <p>No, Azure Event Grid does not guarantee the order of event delivery; if order is crucial, consider using Azure Service Bus instead.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">15. How do you configure a dead-letter destination in Azure Event Grid?</h2>
    <p>You can configure a dead-letter destination in the event subscription settings by specifying an Azure Storage account or Azure Service Bus queue to capture undelivered events.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">16. What is an event handler in the context of Azure Event Grid?</h2>
    <p>An event handler is any service or application that processes events published to Azure Event Grid, such as Azure Functions, Logic Apps, or custom HTTP endpoints.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">17. Can you visualize Azure Event Grid events in real-time?</h2>
    <p>Yes, you can visualize Azure Event Grid events in real-time using Azure Monitor and Azure Log Analytics to create dashboards and alerts based on event data.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">18. How does Azure Event Grid support serverless architectures?</h2>
    <p>Azure Event Grid supports serverless architectures by seamlessly integrating with Azure Functions and Logic Apps, allowing for automated event-driven workflows without managing infrastructure.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">19. What is the maximum number of event subscriptions allowed per topic in Azure Event Grid?</h2>
    <p>The maximum number of event subscriptions allowed per topic is 200 in Azure Event Grid.</p>
