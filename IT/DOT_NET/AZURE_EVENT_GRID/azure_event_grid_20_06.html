<h1>Azure Event Grid Q&A - Part 06</h1>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">1. How does Azure Event Grid improve application responsiveness?</h2>
    <p>Azure Event Grid enables real-time event-driven architectures, allowing applications to respond to events as they happen, thereby improving responsiveness.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">2. Can Azure Event Grid integrate with other Azure services?</h2>
    <p>Yes, Azure Event Grid can easily integrate with a wide range of Azure services such as Azure Functions, Azure Logic Apps, and Azure Automation.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">3. What is the maximum number of event subscriptions you can have for a single event source?</h2>
    <p>You can have up to 200 event subscriptions for a single event source in Azure Event Grid.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">4. What types of protocols can Azure Event Grid use for event delivery?</h2>
    <p>Azure Event Grid supports multiple protocols for event delivery, including HTTP, HTTPS, and Webhooks.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">5. How does Azure Event Grid handle event retries?</h2>
    <p>Azure Event Grid implements an exponential backoff strategy for retrying event delivery to a failing endpoint for up to 24 hours.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">6. Can you use Azure Event Grid for IoT applications?</h2>
    <p>Yes, Azure Event Grid is suitable for IoT applications, enabling event-driven architectures that respond to events generated by IoT devices.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">7. What is an event handler in the context of Azure Event Grid?</h2>
    <p>An event handler is a service or application that processes events sent from Azure Event Grid, such as Azure Functions or Logic Apps.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">8. Can you use Azure Event Grid with custom domains?</h2>
    <p>Yes, you can use Azure Event Grid with custom domains to route events more effectively based on your organizational needs.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">9. What is the purpose of Azure Event Grid schemas?</h2>
    <p>Event schemas define the structure of the events, ensuring that producers and consumers have a common understanding of event formats.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">10. How can you manage permissions for Azure Event Grid?</h2>
    <p>You can manage permissions for Azure Event Grid using Azure Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), allowing you to assign roles and permissions to users and applications.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">11. What is the cost structure of Azure Event Grid?</h2>
    <p>Azure Event Grid pricing is based on the number of operations performed, including event ingress, egress, and management operations.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">12. Can you disable event subscriptions in Azure Event Grid?</h2>
    <p>Yes, you can disable event subscriptions temporarily without deleting them, allowing you to pause event delivery as needed.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">13. How does Azure Event Grid support schema evolution?</h2>
    <p>Azure Event Grid allows for backward-compatible changes in event schemas, enabling producers and consumers to evolve independently.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">14. What are the best practices for designing events in Azure Event Grid?</h2>
    <p>Best practices include using meaningful event names, designing for event idempotency, and keeping event payloads small and focused.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">15. How can you implement security for event delivery in Azure Event Grid?</h2>
    <p>You can implement security by using authentication tokens, Azure Active Directory, and IP whitelisting for event handlers.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">16. What types of events are considered "system events" in Azure Event Grid?</h2>
    <p>System events are events generated by Azure services that inform you about resource changes, such as blob creation or deletion.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">17. Can Azure Event Grid be used for cross-tenant scenarios?</h2>
    <p>Yes, Azure Event Grid supports cross-tenant scenarios, allowing you to send events across different Azure Active Directory tenants.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">18. What is the difference between filtering and routing in Azure Event Grid?</h2>
    <p>Filtering allows you to define which events trigger a subscription, while routing specifies the endpoint that receives the events.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">19. How can you ensure high availability when using Azure Event Grid?</h2>
    <p>By utilizing Azure Event Grid's inherent scalability and redundancy, along with deploying event handlers in multiple regions, you can ensure high availability.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">20. What is the event delivery guarantee provided by Azure Event Grid?</h2>
    <p>Azure Event Grid provides at-least-once delivery guarantees, meaning events may be delivered more than once under certain conditions, and handlers should be designed accordingly.</p>
