<h1>Azure Event Grid Q&A - Part 02</h1>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">1. What are the benefits of using Azure Event Grid?</h2>
    <p>Azure Event Grid provides benefits such as simplified event routing, automatic event handling, and reduced application complexity by enabling event-driven architectures.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">2. How do you enable diagnostics for Azure Event Grid?</h2>
    <p>Diagnostics can be enabled through Azure Monitor by configuring metrics, logs, and alerts to track event delivery and performance.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">3. What is the maximum retention period for events in Azure Event Grid?</h2>
    <p>Events in Azure Event Grid are retained for 24 hours, after which they are discarded if not successfully delivered to the subscribers.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">4. How can you ensure event durability in Azure Event Grid?</h2>
    <p>Event durability can be ensured by using features like dead-lettering, which stores undelivered events for further analysis or reprocessing.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">5. Can Azure Event Grid handle large volumes of events?</h2>
    <p>Yes, Azure Event Grid is designed to handle millions of events per second, making it suitable for high-throughput scenarios.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">6. What is a domain in Azure Event Grid?</h2>
    <p>A domain is a way to group multiple event sources together to simplify the management of event subscriptions and events.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">7. How do you authenticate requests to Azure Event Grid?</h2>
    <p>Requests to Azure Event Grid can be authenticated using Azure Active Directory, managed identities, or shared access signatures (SAS).</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">8. What types of delivery guarantees does Azure Event Grid provide?</h2>
    <p>Azure Event Grid provides at-least-once delivery guarantees, ensuring that events are delivered at least once to subscribers.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">9. Can you route events from Azure Event Grid to multiple subscribers?</h2>
    <p>Yes, you can configure multiple event subscriptions to the same event source, allowing multiple subscribers to receive the same events.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">10. How does Azure Event Grid integrate with Azure Logic Apps?</h2>
    <p>Azure Logic Apps can be triggered by events from Event Grid, allowing you to automate workflows based on those events.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">11. What is the role of the Event Grid CLI?</h2>
    <p>The Event Grid CLI allows users to manage Azure Event Grid resources and event subscriptions via command-line commands, facilitating automation and scripting.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">12. How can you use Azure Event Grid with Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)?</h2>
    <p>Azure Event Grid can be integrated with AKS to trigger containerized applications or functions based on events such as blob creation or queue messages.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">13. Can you customize the event schema in Azure Event Grid?</h2>
    <p>Yes, when publishing custom events, you can define your own event schema to include relevant data for your application needs.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">14. How does Azure Event Grid manage event timeouts?</h2>
    <p>If an event cannot be delivered after several retries within the timeout period, it is sent to a dead-letter destination if configured.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">15. What is a WebHook endpoint in Azure Event Grid?</h2>
    <p>A WebHook endpoint is a user-defined HTTP endpoint that can receive events from Event Grid, allowing custom applications to process those events.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">16. Can Azure Event Grid send events to Azure Service Bus?</h2>
    <p>Yes, you can configure Azure Event Grid to send events to Azure Service Bus queues or topics for further processing or routing.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">17. How do you update an event subscription in Azure Event Grid?</h2>
    <p>Event subscriptions can be updated using the Azure portal, Azure CLI, or REST API to change settings like filters, endpoint, or dead-letter destination.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">18. What is the difference between a topic and a domain in Azure Event Grid?</h2>
    <p>A topic is a single event source that can publish events, while a domain is a grouping of multiple topics to streamline event management.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">19. Can Azure Event Grid integrate with Azure Event Hubs?</h2>
    <p>Yes, you can route events from Azure Event Grid to Azure Event Hubs for large-scale event streaming and processing scenarios.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">20. How do you delete an event subscription in Azure Event Grid?</h2>
    <p>Event subscriptions can be deleted through the Azure portal, Azure CLI, or REST API by specifying the event subscription's identifier.</p>
