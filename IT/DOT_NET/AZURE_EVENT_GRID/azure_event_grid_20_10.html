<h1>Azure Event Grid Q&A - Part 10</h1>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">1. What types of events can Azure Event Grid handle?</h2>
    <p>Azure Event Grid can handle system events from Azure services, custom events from your applications, and third-party events from external sources.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">2. How does Azure Event Grid improve application scalability?</h2>
    <p>Azure Event Grid improves application scalability by decoupling event producers from event consumers, allowing them to scale independently based on demand.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">3. What is the difference between a domain and a topic in Azure Event Grid?</h2>
    <p>A domain is a higher-level grouping for related event topics, while a topic is a specific endpoint where events are published and subscribed to.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">4. How does Azure Event Grid support microservices architecture?</h2>
    <p>Azure Event Grid facilitates microservices architecture by enabling services to communicate through events rather than direct calls, promoting loose coupling.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">5. Can you create multiple event handlers for a single event type in Azure Event Grid?</h2>
    <p>Yes, you can create multiple event handlers for a single event type by setting up multiple subscriptions to that event type.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">6. What authentication methods can be used with Azure Event Grid?</h2>
    <p>Azure Event Grid supports various authentication methods, including Azure Active Directory, Shared Access Signature (SAS), and webhooks with validation tokens.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">7. How can you ensure event delivery reliability in Azure Event Grid?</h2>
    <p>You can ensure event delivery reliability by utilizing the built-in retry policies and dead-lettering features to handle failed deliveries.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">8. What role do filters play in Azure Event Grid?</h2>
    <p>Filters in Azure Event Grid allow you to specify conditions that events must meet for an event handler to process them, reducing unnecessary processing.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">9. How can you manage costs associated with Azure Event Grid?</h2>
    <p>You can manage costs by optimizing your event routing strategies, minimizing unnecessary event publishing, and using monitoring tools to track usage.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">10. Can Azure Event Grid be used to integrate with Azure Logic Apps?</h2>
    <p>Yes, Azure Event Grid can be integrated with Azure Logic Apps to automate workflows based on specific events.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">11. How do you secure event subscriptions in Azure Event Grid?</h2>
    <p>You can secure event subscriptions using access policies, authentication tokens, and IP filtering to restrict who can send or receive events.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">12. What are the limitations of Azure Event Grid?</h2>
    <p>Limitations include the maximum size of events (1 MB), the number of topics and subscriptions per Azure region, and the maximum number of retries for event delivery.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">13. How can you create an event grid topic using Azure CLI?</h2>
    <p>You can create an event grid topic using Azure CLI with the command <code>az eventgrid topic create --name <topic-name> --resource-group <resource-group-name></code>.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">14. What happens if an event fails to deliver to an event handler?</h2>
    <p>If an event fails to deliver, Azure Event Grid will retry delivery for a specified duration and can send the event to a dead-letter destination if it continues to fail.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">15. Can Azure Event Grid work with IoT devices?</h2>
    <p>Yes, Azure Event Grid can be used to manage events generated by IoT devices, allowing for real-time event processing and analytics.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">16. How do you troubleshoot issues in Azure Event Grid?</h2>
    <p>You can troubleshoot issues by checking event delivery logs, monitoring metrics, and using Azure Monitor for diagnostics and alerts.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">17. Can you use Azure Event Grid for serverless applications?</h2>
    <p>Yes, Azure Event Grid is often used in serverless architectures to trigger Azure Functions or Logic Apps based on events.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">18. How is event schema versioning handled in Azure Event Grid?</h2>
    <p>Event schema versioning can be handled by including version information in the event payload and implementing logic in subscribers to manage different versions.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">19. What are some best practices for using Azure Event Grid?</h2>
    <p>Best practices include designing a proper event schema, using filters effectively, monitoring performance, and handling failures gracefully.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">20. How can you test Azure Event Grid configurations?</h2>
    <p>You can test Azure Event Grid configurations by publishing test events using tools like Postman or Azure CLI and verifying that subscribers process the events correctly.</p>
