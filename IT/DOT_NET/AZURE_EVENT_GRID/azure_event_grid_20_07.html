<h1>Azure Event Grid Q&A - Part 07</h1>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">1. What is the primary use case for Azure Event Grid?</h2>
    <p>The primary use case for Azure Event Grid is to build event-driven applications that react to state changes in other services or resources.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">2. Can you define custom event types in Azure Event Grid?</h2>
    <p>Yes, you can define custom event types and schemas in Azure Event Grid, allowing for greater flexibility in event-driven architectures.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">3. How are events structured in Azure Event Grid?</h2>
    <p>Events in Azure Event Grid are structured as JSON objects containing properties like event type, subject, data, and event time.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">4. What mechanisms does Azure Event Grid use for event routing?</h2>
    <p>Azure Event Grid uses topics and subscriptions for routing events to the appropriate event handlers based on filters.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">5. Can you filter events in Azure Event Grid?</h2>
    <p>Yes, you can apply filters to event subscriptions to ensure that only relevant events are sent to specific event handlers.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">6. How can you monitor events in Azure Event Grid?</h2>
    <p>You can monitor events in Azure Event Grid using Azure Monitor, which provides metrics and logs for event delivery and failures.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">7. What are the default retention policies for events in Azure Event Grid?</h2>
    <p>Azure Event Grid retains events for 24 hours in case of delivery failures, allowing for retries within that window.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">8. How do you create an event subscription in Azure Event Grid?</h2>
    <p>You can create an event subscription via the Azure Portal, Azure CLI, or Azure SDKs by specifying the endpoint and filtering options.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">9. What is a Domain in Azure Event Grid?</h2>
    <p>A Domain in Azure Event Grid is a way to group multiple event sources and subscriptions, allowing for centralized management of events.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">10. Can Azure Event Grid handle large volumes of events?</h2>
    <p>Yes, Azure Event Grid is designed to handle millions of events per second, making it suitable for large-scale applications.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">11. What is the difference between Azure Event Grid and Azure Service Bus?</h2>
    <p>Azure Event Grid is designed for event-driven architectures, while Azure Service Bus is more suited for messaging scenarios with queues and topics.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">12. How does Azure Event Grid ensure reliable event delivery?</h2>
    <p>Azure Event Grid ensures reliable event delivery through automatic retries, dead-lettering for failed events, and persistent storage of events for a limited time.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">13. Can you use Azure Event Grid for monitoring Azure resources?</h2>
    <p>Yes, Azure Event Grid can be used to monitor Azure resources by subscribing to system events generated by those resources.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">14. How are events serialized in Azure Event Grid?</h2>
    <p>Events in Azure Event Grid are serialized as JSON, enabling easy integration and processing by various services and applications.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">15. What happens if an event handler fails to process an event?</h2>
    <p>If an event handler fails to process an event, Azure Event Grid will retry delivery based on an exponential backoff strategy for up to 24 hours.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">16. Can Azure Event Grid send events to non-Azure services?</h2>
    <p>Yes, Azure Event Grid can send events to any HTTP endpoint, allowing integration with non-Azure services and applications.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">17. How do you enable diagnostics for Azure Event Grid?</h2>
    <p>You can enable diagnostics by configuring Azure Monitor to collect logs and metrics for Azure Event Grid events and subscriptions.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">18. What is a dead-letter destination in Azure Event Grid?</h2>
    <p>A dead-letter destination is a storage account or Azure Service Bus queue where failed events can be sent for further analysis and troubleshooting.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">19. Can you set up custom event handling logic using Azure Functions?</h2>
    <p>Yes, Azure Functions can be used to implement custom logic for handling events received from Azure Event Grid.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">20. How do you handle duplicate events in Azure Event Grid?</h2>
    <p>To handle duplicate events, you should design your event handlers to be idempotent, meaning they can safely process the same event multiple times without unintended effects.</p>
</div>
