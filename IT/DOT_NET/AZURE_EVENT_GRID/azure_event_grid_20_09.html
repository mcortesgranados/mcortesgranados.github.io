<h1>Azure Event Grid Q&A - Part 09</h1>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">1. What is the primary purpose of Azure Event Grid?</h2>
    <p>The primary purpose of Azure Event Grid is to enable event-driven architectures by providing a unified event routing service to handle events from various sources.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">2. How does Azure Event Grid ensure high availability?</h2>
    <p>Azure Event Grid ensures high availability by distributing events across multiple regions and implementing automatic failover mechanisms.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">3. What is an event schema in Azure Event Grid?</h2>
    <p>An event schema in Azure Event Grid defines the structure of the event data, which includes attributes like event type, subject, and data fields.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">4. Can Azure Event Grid be used for both internal and external events?</h2>
    <p>Yes, Azure Event Grid can handle both internal Azure service events and external events from third-party services or custom applications.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">5. What is a custom topic in Azure Event Grid?</h2>
    <p>A custom topic is a user-defined event topic in Azure Event Grid that allows you to publish events from your own applications or services.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">6. How do you monitor the health of Azure Event Grid?</h2>
    <p>You can monitor the health of Azure Event Grid through Azure Monitor, which provides metrics, logs, and alerts for your Event Grid resources.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">7. What happens to events that are not delivered after the maximum retry attempts?</h2>
    <p>Events that are not delivered after the maximum retry attempts can be sent to a dead-letter destination, such as an Azure Storage account or Service Bus queue, for later inspection.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">8. How do you configure filters for event subscriptions?</h2>
    <p>Filters for event subscriptions can be configured by specifying event types, subject filters, or even advanced filters based on specific criteria.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">9. Can you use Azure Event Grid with Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)?</h2>
    <p>Yes, Azure Event Grid can be integrated with Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) to manage event-driven applications running in Kubernetes.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">10. What is the role of Azure Functions in conjunction with Azure Event Grid?</h2>
    <p>Azure Functions can act as event handlers that respond to events published to Azure Event Grid, enabling serverless event-driven processing.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">11. How can you handle event schema changes in Azure Event Grid?</h2>
    <p>To handle event schema changes, you can implement versioning in your events, allowing subscribers to adapt to changes over time.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">12. Can Azure Event Grid support multiple event handlers for a single event?</h2>
    <p>Yes, Azure Event Grid can support multiple event handlers for a single event by creating multiple subscriptions to the same event topic.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">13. What is the default retry duration for failed event deliveries?</h2>
    <p>The default retry duration for failed event deliveries is 24 hours, during which Azure Event Grid will attempt to resend the event.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">14. How do you set up an event subscription for a custom topic?</h2>
    <p>To set up an event subscription for a custom topic, you can use the Azure Portal, Azure CLI, or ARM templates to specify the event handler and filters.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">15. Can Azure Event Grid be used with Azure Logic Apps for workflow automation?</h2>
    <p>Yes, Azure Event Grid can be used with Azure Logic Apps to create automated workflows that respond to specific events.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">16. What are some common use cases for Azure Event Grid?</h2>
    <p>Common use cases include triggering serverless functions, integrating with external systems, real-time analytics, and monitoring changes in resources.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">17. Can you publish events to Azure Event Grid using HTTP POST requests?</h2>
    <p>Yes, you can publish events to Azure Event Grid using HTTP POST requests to the event endpoint specified for your topic.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">18. How can you manage event subscriptions programmatically?</h2>
    <p>You can manage event subscriptions programmatically using Azure SDKs or REST APIs to create, update, or delete subscriptions as needed.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">19. What is the maximum size of an event published to Azure Event Grid?</h2>
    <p>The maximum size of an event published to Azure Event Grid is 1 MB.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">20. How does Azure Event Grid differ from Azure Service Bus?</h2>
    <p>Azure Event Grid is designed for event routing with a focus on event-driven architectures, while Azure Service Bus is a messaging service that provides features for queueing and message durability.</p>
