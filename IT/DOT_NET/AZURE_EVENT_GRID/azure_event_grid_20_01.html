<h1>Azure Event Grid Q&A - Part 01</h1>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">1. What is Azure Event Grid?</h2>
    <p>Azure Event Grid is a fully managed event routing service that enables you to build event-driven applications by providing a way to connect different services through events.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">2. What types of events can Azure Event Grid handle?</h2>
    <p>Event Grid can handle platform events (such as Azure Blob Storage and Azure Resource Manager events) and custom events generated by your applications.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">3. How does Azure Event Grid achieve high availability?</h2>
    <p>Event Grid is designed to be highly available with automatic event delivery and redundant infrastructure across multiple regions.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">4. What is the role of an event publisher in Azure Event Grid?</h2>
    <p>An event publisher is a source that sends events to Event Grid, which can be Azure services or your own applications generating custom events.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">5. What is an event subscriber in Azure Event Grid?</h2>
    <p>An event subscriber is a destination that receives events from Event Grid. Subscribers can include Azure Functions, WebHooks, and other Azure services.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">6. Can Azure Event Grid support filtering of events?</h2>
    <p>Yes, Azure Event Grid supports filtering to allow subscribers to only receive events that match specific criteria, reducing unnecessary processing.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">7. What is a dead-letter destination in Azure Event Grid?</h2>
    <p>A dead-letter destination is a storage location where undeliverable events can be sent for further investigation and processing when delivery fails.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">8. How do you secure events sent to Azure Event Grid?</h2>
    <p>Events can be secured using authentication mechanisms such as Azure Active Directory, SAS tokens, and HTTPS to ensure secure communication.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">9. What is the difference between Event Grid and Azure Service Bus?</h2>
    <p>Event Grid is event-driven and best for reactive architectures, while Azure Service Bus is message-oriented, suitable for scenarios requiring message queuing and complex workflows.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">10. How can you monitor Azure Event Grid?</h2>
    <p>Monitoring can be done through Azure Monitor, which provides metrics, logs, and alerts for events and subscriptions to help track event delivery and performance.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">11. What are the pricing components of Azure Event Grid?</h2>
    <p>Pricing is based on the number of operations (events published and delivered), with additional costs for features like dead-lettering and high throughput.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">12. How do you create an event subscription in Azure Event Grid?</h2>
    <p>Event subscriptions can be created using the Azure portal, Azure CLI, or ARM templates, specifying the event type and subscriber endpoint.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">13. Can you retry failed event deliveries in Azure Event Grid?</h2>
    <p>Yes, Event Grid automatically retries event delivery for a predefined period and allows configuration for additional retries for certain types of events.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">14. What are custom topics in Azure Event Grid?</h2>
    <p>Custom topics are user-defined event sources in Azure Event Grid, allowing you to send your own events to the grid and route them to subscribers.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">15. How does Azure Event Grid handle schema validation?</h2>
    <p>Event Grid performs schema validation against the events it receives and can reject events that do not conform to the expected schema.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">16. Can you use Azure Event Grid with non-Azure services?</h2>
    <p>Yes, you can integrate Azure Event Grid with non-Azure services using WebHook endpoints or custom applications that support HTTP requests.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">17. How does Azure Event Grid handle event ordering?</h2>
    <p>Event Grid does not guarantee the order of event delivery unless events are published to a single topic with a single publisher.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">18. What is the maximum size of an event in Azure Event Grid?</h2>
    <p>The maximum size of an event in Azure Event Grid is 1 MB, which includes both the event payload and metadata.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">19. How can you use Azure Event Grid to trigger Azure Functions?</h2>
    <p>Azure Functions can be triggered by events published to Event Grid by creating an event subscription that points to the Azure Function as the endpoint.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">20. What is the purpose of the Azure Event Grid schema?</h2>
    <p>The Azure Event Grid schema defines the structure and format of events, ensuring consistent data representation across different event sources and consumers.</p>
</div>
