<h1>Azure Event Grid Q&A - Part 04</h1>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">1. What is the maximum size of an event in Azure Event Grid?</h2>
    <p>The maximum size of an event published to Azure Event Grid is 1 MB.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">2. How can you configure a dead-letter destination in Azure Event Grid?</h2>
    <p>A dead-letter destination can be configured during event subscription creation by specifying an Azure Storage account or Azure Event Hubs for undelivered events.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">3. Can Azure Event Grid integrate with third-party applications?</h2>
    <p>Yes, Azure Event Grid can integrate with third-party applications using webhooks, allowing external services to receive and respond to events.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">4. What are system topics in Azure Event Grid?</h2>
    <p>System topics are predefined event sources that Azure services publish events to, such as Blob Storage, Event Hubs, and Azure Resource Manager.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">5. How can you test event delivery in Azure Event Grid?</h2>
    <p>Event delivery can be tested by publishing sample events to a topic and monitoring the event handler or endpoint for received events.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">6. What is the purpose of the event handler in Azure Event Grid?</h2>
    <p>The event handler is responsible for processing events delivered by Azure Event Grid, performing actions based on the event data.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">7. Can you configure event delivery retries for Azure Event Grid?</h2>
    <p>Yes, Azure Event Grid automatically retries delivery for failed events for a duration of up to 24 hours before considering them undeliverable.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">8. What is the difference between Event Grid and Event Hubs?</h2>
    <p>Event Grid is designed for event routing and event-driven architectures, while Event Hubs is optimized for large-scale data ingestion and stream processing.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">9. How do you enable diagnostics for Azure Event Grid?</h2>
    <p>Diagnostics can be enabled through the Azure portal, allowing you to monitor and collect logs and metrics related to event delivery and performance.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">

    <p>Yes, Azure Event Grid can directly trigger Azure Functions, enabling serverless processing of events as they occur.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">14. What are the common use cases for Azure Event Grid?</h2>
    <p>Common use cases include application integration, real-time notifications, data processing, and implementing serverless architectures.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">15. How can you manage Azure Event Grid programmatically?</h2>
    <p>Azure Event Grid can be managed programmatically using Azure SDKs, Azure CLI, and REST APIs, allowing for automation and custom integrations.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">16. What are the benefits of using Azure Event Grid?</h2>
    <p>Benefits include simplified event routing, serverless integration, scalability, and reduced complexity in event-driven architectures.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">17. How do you handle schema evolution in Azure Event Grid?</h2>
    <p>Schema evolution can be managed by using versioning in event types and ensuring backward compatibility in event handlers to accommodate changes.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">18. Can you view event delivery logs in Azure Event Grid?</h2>
    <p>Yes, event delivery logs can be viewed through Azure Monitor or by enabling diagnostics, providing insights into successful and failed deliveries.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">19. What is a topic in Azure Event Grid?</h2>
    <p>A topic is an endpoint where events are published. It can be a system topic associated with Azure services or a custom topic created by the user.</p>
