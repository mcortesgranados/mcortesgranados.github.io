<h1>Azure Event Grid Q&A - Part 05</h1>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">1. What types of events can be published to Azure Event Grid?</h2>
    <p>Azure Event Grid supports multiple event types, including custom events, system events from Azure services, and third-party events.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">2. How does Azure Event Grid achieve high availability?</h2>
    <p>Azure Event Grid is designed with a fully managed, scalable, and redundant architecture that ensures high availability and reliability of event delivery.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">3. Can Azure Event Grid filter events?</h2>
    <p>Yes, Azure Event Grid allows you to create filters on event subscriptions, enabling you to specify which events should trigger the event handler based on event properties.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">4. What is the difference between a topic and a domain in Azure Event Grid?</h2>
    <p>A topic is an endpoint where events are sent, while a domain is a container for multiple topics, allowing you to manage and publish events from multiple sources.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">5. How does Azure Event Grid support serverless architectures?</h2>
    <p>Azure Event Grid seamlessly integrates with serverless services like Azure Functions and Logic Apps, enabling event-driven computing without managing infrastructure.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">6. What are the key benefits of using Azure Event Grid for event-driven applications?</h2>
    <p>Key benefits include reduced latency, cost-effectiveness, scalability, and simplified event routing, allowing developers to build responsive applications.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">7. How can you monitor the health of Azure Event Grid?</h2>
    <p>You can monitor Azure Event Grid using Azure Monitor, which provides insights into event delivery metrics, failed deliveries, and overall system health.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">8. What is the purpose of the event schema in Azure Event Grid?</h2>
    <p>The event schema defines the structure and content of events published to Azure Event Grid, ensuring consistency and interoperability between producers and consumers.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">9. Can you customize the event schema in Azure Event Grid?</h2>
    <p>Yes, you can define custom event schemas to meet your application's requirements while adhering to the general structure required by Azure Event Grid.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">10. What happens if an event handler is not available when an event is sent?</h2>
    <p>If an event handler is not available, Azure Event Grid will attempt to deliver the event to the handler according to the configured retry policy for a maximum of 24 hours.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">11. How can you ensure events are processed exactly once in Azure Event Grid?</h2>
    <p>While Azure Event Grid provides at-least-once delivery, you can implement deduplication logic in your event handlers to ensure events are processed exactly once.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">12. Can Azure Event Grid integrate with Azure Logic Apps?</h2>
    <p>Yes, Azure Event Grid can trigger Azure Logic Apps, allowing you to automate workflows in response to events without writing code.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">13. What is a custom event in Azure Event Grid?</h2>
    <p>A custom event is an event created by a user or application that conforms to the Azure Event Grid event schema and is sent to a custom topic.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">14. Can you send events to Azure Event Grid from on-premises applications?</h2>
    <p>Yes, you can send events to Azure Event Grid from on-premises applications by using the Azure Event Grid REST API or SDKs.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">15. How does Azure Event Grid handle high throughput of events?</h2>
    <p>Azure Event Grid is designed to handle high throughput and can process millions of events per second by scaling automatically based on demand.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">16. What kind of authentication does Azure Event Grid support?</h2>
    <p>Azure Event Grid supports various authentication mechanisms, including Azure Active Directory, shared access signatures (SAS), and webhooks with authentication tokens.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">17. Can you configure Azure Event Grid to route events to multiple endpoints?</h2>
    <p>Yes, you can create multiple event subscriptions for a single topic, routing the same events to different endpoints or handlers as needed.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">18. What are advanced filters in Azure Event Grid?</h2>
    <p>Advanced filters allow you to specify complex filtering criteria for event subscriptions, enabling fine-grained control over which events trigger the subscription.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">19. How can you handle schema validation for events in Azure Event Grid?</h2>
    <p>You can implement schema validation within your event handlers to ensure that the received events conform to expected formats and structures.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">20. What role does Azure Resource Manager play in Azure Event Grid?</h2>
    <p>Azure Resource Manager allows you to manage Azure resources and can send resource-related events to Azure Event Grid for further processing and automation.</p>
