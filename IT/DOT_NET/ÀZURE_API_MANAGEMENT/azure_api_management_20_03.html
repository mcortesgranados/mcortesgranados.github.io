<h1>Azure API Management Q&A - Part 03</h1>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">1. What is the difference between an API and a microservice?</h2>
    <p>An API is a set of rules and protocols for building and interacting with software applications, while a microservice is an architectural style that structures an application as a collection of loosely coupled services that implement business capabilities.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">2. How do you secure APIs in Azure API Management?</h2>
    <p>APIs can be secured in Azure API Management using policies such as requiring API keys, validating JWT tokens, and implementing IP filtering.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">3. What is an API product in Azure API Management?</h2>
    <p>An API product is a bundle of one or more APIs that can be offered to developers, often with specific access policies, usage quotas, and subscription plans.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">4. What are policies in Azure API Management?</h2>
    <p>Policies are a set of configurable rules that enable you to modify the behavior of APIs in Azure API Management, including request/response transformations, rate limiting, and caching.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">5. Can Azure API Management be used for hybrid and multi-cloud scenarios?</h2>
    <p>Yes, Azure API Management can be used in hybrid and multi-cloud scenarios to manage APIs across different cloud environments and on-premises systems.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">6. What is the Developer Portal in Azure API Management?</h2>
    <p>The Developer Portal is a customizable web interface that allows developers to discover, learn about, and interact with the APIs managed by Azure API Management.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">7. How can you monitor API performance in Azure API Management?</h2>
    <p>API performance can be monitored using the Azure portal's analytics features, which provide insights into request counts, response times, and error rates.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">8. What is a subscription key in Azure API Management?</h2>
    <p>A subscription key is a unique identifier issued to developers that allows them to access APIs in Azure API Management, enforcing access control and usage tracking.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">9. Can you customize the look and feel of the Developer Portal?</h2>
    <p>Yes, the Developer Portal in Azure API Management can be customized with branding, layouts, and content to provide a tailored experience for developers.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">10. What is the role of the backend service in Azure API Management?</h2>
    <p>The backend service is the actual implementation of the API, which Azure API Management proxies requests to after applying policies and transformations.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">11. How does Azure API Management support API testing?</h2>
    <p>Azure API Management provides a built-in test console in the Developer Portal that allows developers to make test calls to APIs and inspect responses without writing code.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">12. What are the different pricing tiers available for Azure API Management?</h2>
    <p>Azure API Management offers various pricing tiers, including Developer, Basic, Standard, and Premium, each with different capabilities, performance levels, and cost structures.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">13. How can you log API calls in Azure API Management?</h2>
    <p>API calls can be logged in Azure API Management using policies to write logs to Azure Monitor or to external logging solutions for auditing and troubleshooting.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">14. What is API transformation in Azure API Management?</h2>
    <p>API transformation involves modifying requests and responses on the fly, such as changing headers, modifying JSON/XML structures, or converting formats.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">15. How does Azure API Management help with API versioning?</h2>
    <p>Azure API Management allows you to manage multiple versions of APIs, routing requests to the appropriate version based on user subscriptions or request parameters.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">16. Can Azure API Management integrate with Azure Active Directory?</h2>
    <p>Yes, Azure API Management can integrate with Azure Active Directory for authentication, allowing users to authenticate against Azure AD to access APIs.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">17. What is a backend service URL in Azure API Management?</h2>
    <p>The backend service URL is the endpoint of the actual API implementation that Azure API Management forwards requests to after processing.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">18. How can you automate the deployment of APIs in Azure API Management?</h2>
    <p>Automating the deployment of APIs can be achieved through Azure Resource Manager templates, Azure DevOps pipelines, or Azure CLI commands.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">19. What is the significance of using OpenAPI specifications with Azure API Management?</h2>
    <p>OpenAPI specifications allow you to define APIs in a standard format, making it easier to import, document, and test APIs within Azure API Management.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">20. How do you handle API throttling in Azure API Management?</h2>
    <p>API throttling can be handled using policies that limit the number of calls to APIs per subscription, helping to prevent abuse and ensuring fair usage among developers.</p>
