<h1>Azure API Management Q&A - Part 07</h1>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">1. What is the purpose of policies in Azure API Management?</h2>
    <p>Policies in Azure API Management are a set of rules that can be applied to APIs to control behaviors like transformations, caching, security, and traffic management.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">2. How can you apply rate limiting in Azure API Management?</h2>
    <p>Rate limiting can be applied using the rate-limit-by-key policy, which allows you to restrict the number of calls made to an API by a specific user or client over a defined period.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">3. What is the Developer Portal in Azure API Management?</h2>
    <p>The Developer Portal is a customizable web application that provides developers with access to API documentation, interactive testing, and subscription management features.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">4. Can you manage multiple versions of an API in Azure API Management?</h2>
    <p>Yes, Azure API Management allows you to manage multiple versions of an API, enabling you to support versioning strategies and maintain backward compatibility.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">5. What are "subscription keys" in Azure API Management?</h2>
    <p>Subscription keys are unique identifiers provided to developers for authenticating requests made to the APIs, allowing for usage tracking and access control.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">6. How can you implement API versioning?</h2>
    <p>API versioning can be implemented in Azure API Management through URL path, query string, or request headers, allowing clients to specify which version they wish to use.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">7. What are "backend services" in Azure API Management?</h2>
    <p>Backend services refer to the actual APIs or services that are being managed and exposed through Azure API Management, serving as the endpoints that handle requests.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">8. How does Azure API Management support monitoring and analytics?</h2>
    <p>Azure API Management provides built-in monitoring and analytics features that allow you to track API usage, performance metrics, and error rates through Azure Monitor and Application Insights.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">9. What is the purpose of the "request-response" transformation policy?</h2>
    <p>The request-response transformation policy allows you to modify requests before they are sent to the backend and responses before they are returned to clients, enabling data manipulation and formatting.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">10. Can you integrate Azure API Management with external identity providers?</h2>
    <p>Yes, Azure API Management can be integrated with external identity providers like OAuth, OpenID Connect, and Azure Active Directory to enable authentication and authorization for API access.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">11. How do you create and manage API products?</h2>
    <p>API products can be created and managed through the Azure portal, where you can define the APIs included, set policies, and configure subscription levels for different users.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">12. What is the significance of the "IP filter" policy?</h2>
    <p>The IP filter policy allows you to restrict access to your APIs by specifying allowed or blocked IP addresses, enhancing security by controlling which clients can connect.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">13. How does caching improve API performance?</h2>
    <p>Caching improves API performance by storing responses temporarily, reducing the need to call the backend service for frequently requested data, which speeds up response times and reduces load.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">14. Can Azure API Management handle throttling?</h2>
    <p>Yes, Azure API Management supports throttling, which can be configured to limit the number of API calls a user can make within a specified time frame to prevent abuse and ensure fair usage.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">15. What is the purpose of the "retry" policy?</h2>
    <p>The retry policy allows you to automatically retry a failed request to the backend service based on specified conditions, which helps improve resilience and reliability.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">16. How can you enable HTTPS for your APIs?</h2>
    <p>HTTPS can be enabled for APIs in Azure API Management by configuring custom domains with SSL certificates to secure the communication between clients and the API gateway.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">17. What is a "schema" in the context of API Management?</h2>
    <p>A schema defines the structure and data types of the API request and response payloads, allowing for validation and ensuring that the data conforms to expected formats.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">18. How do you handle logging in Azure API Management?</h2>
    <p>Logging can be handled by configuring policies that log requests and responses, along with custom data, to Azure Application Insights or other logging services for monitoring and analysis.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">19. Can you set up alerts for API performance metrics?</h2>
    <p>Yes, you can set up alerts in Azure Monitor based on specific performance metrics from Azure API Management to notify you when certain thresholds are exceeded.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h2 class="question">20. What role do "certificates" play in API Management?</h2>
    <p>Certificates are used for securing communications, authenticating requests, and encrypting data between clients and APIs, ensuring that sensitive information is protected during transmission.</p>
