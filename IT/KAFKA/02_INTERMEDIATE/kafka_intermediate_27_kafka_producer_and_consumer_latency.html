    <h1>Kafka Producer and Consumer Latency</h1>
    <p>Latency in Kafka refers to the delay experienced when producing or consuming messages. Optimizing latency is crucial for achieving real-time data processing and minimizing delays in data pipelines.</p>
    
    <h2>1. Producer Latency</h2>
    <p>Producer latency can be affected by several factors including network conditions, message size, and configuration settings. Here are key settings to optimize producer latency:</p>
    
    <h3>Producer Configuration</h3>
    <div class="code">
        # Acknowledgment configuration<br>
        acks=1  # Set to 1 for lower latency, but riskier<br><br>
        
        # Batch size and linger time<br>
        batch.size=16384  # Size of batch in bytes<br>
        linger.ms=5  # Time to wait before sending batch<br><br>
        
        # Compression configuration<br>
        compression.type=lz4  # Choose compression type to balance latency and throughput<br>
    </div>
    
    <h3>Producer Tuning Tips</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Decrease `acks`:</strong> Setting `acks=0` or `acks=1` reduces latency but may risk data loss.</li>
        <li><strong>Optimize `batch.size` and `linger.ms`:</strong> Larger batches and longer linger times can reduce latency by improving throughput.</li>
        <li><strong>Choose Efficient Compression:</strong> Use compression types that offer a good balance between latency and compression ratio.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>2. Consumer Latency</h2>
    <p>Consumer latency is influenced by factors such as message processing time, fetch size, and network delays. Key settings to improve consumer latency include:</p>
    
    <h3>Consumer Configuration</h3>
    <div class="code">
        # Fetch size and wait time<br>
        fetch.min.bytes=1  # Minimum amount of data the server should return<br>
        fetch.max.wait.ms=500  # Maximum time to wait for fetch data<br><br>
        
        # Polling configuration<br>
        max.poll.records=500  # Maximum records returned per poll<br><br>
        
        # Consumer session timeout<br>
        session.timeout.ms=10000  # Timeout for detecting consumer failures
    </div>
    
    <h3>Consumer Tuning Tips</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Decrease `fetch.max.wait.ms`:</strong> Reducing wait time can decrease latency but may increase the number of fetch requests.</li>
        <li><strong>Adjust `fetch.min.bytes`:</strong> Setting this to a lower value can reduce latency but might increase the number of fetch requests.</li>
        <li><strong>Optimize `max.poll.records`:</strong> Choose a value that balances between processing speed and the number of records fetched.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>3. Monitoring and Measuring Latency</h2>
    <p>Regular monitoring helps identify latency issues and performance bottlenecks. Key metrics to monitor include:</p>
    
    <h3>Monitoring Tools</h3>
    <div class="code">
        # Use Kafka's JMX metrics<br>
        # Producer metrics:<br>
        kafka.producer:type=producer-metrics,client-id=producer-1<br>
        # Consumer metrics:<br>
        kafka.consumer:type=consumer-fetch-manager-metrics,client-id=consumer-1
    </div>
    
    <h3>Latency Measurement</h3>
    <div class="code">
        # Measure end-to-end latency with custom instrumentation<br>
        # For example, use timestamps in producers and consumers to calculate latency
    </div>
