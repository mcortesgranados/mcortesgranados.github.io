    <h1>Kafka: Basic Streams Concepts</h1>
    <p>Kafka Streams is a client library for processing and analyzing data stored in Kafka. It provides a high-level API to perform stream processing and allows for building real-time applications and microservices. Here are the key concepts of Kafka Streams:</p>

    <h2>1. Introduction to Kafka Streams</h2>
    <p>Kafka Streams is a library within the Apache Kafka ecosystem that enables stream processing directly within a Java application. It integrates with Kafka to provide powerful and scalable stream processing capabilities.</p>

    <h2>2. Stream Processing</h2>
    <p>Stream processing involves real-time processing of data as it arrives. Kafka Streams processes records from Kafka topics in real-time and supports various operations, such as filtering, mapping, and aggregating data.</p>

    <h2>3. Basic Components of Kafka Streams</h2>
    <p>Key components in Kafka Streams include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Streams:</strong> Represent continuous flows of records. A stream is a sequence of records in Kafka topics.</li>
        <li><strong>Tables:</strong> Represent data as a changelog stream. Tables allow for stateful operations and maintaining a current view of data.</li>
        <li><strong>Topology:</strong> Defines the processing logic and the sequence of operations applied to the streams.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Streams API</h2>
    <p>The Kafka Streams API provides a high-level abstraction for processing data streams. Key elements include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Stream:</strong> Represents a sequence of records. You can create a stream from a Kafka topic.</li>
        <li><strong>Table:</strong> Represents a collection of records with a unique key. Tables are used for stateful operations.</li>
        <li><strong>Topology:</strong> Defines the operations and data transformations performed on the streams.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Kafka Streams Operations</h2>
    <p>Kafka Streams supports various operations to process and transform data, such as:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Map:</strong> Transform records by applying a function.</li>
        <li><strong>Filter:</strong> Remove records that do not meet a certain condition.</li>
        <li><strong>Reduce:</strong> Aggregate records by applying a reduction function.</li>
        <li><strong>Join:</strong> Combine records from different streams or tables.</li>
        <li><strong>Aggregate:</strong> Group and aggregate records based on keys.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Example Kafka Streams Application</h2>
    <p>Here is a basic
