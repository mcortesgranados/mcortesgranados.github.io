    <h1>Kafka Performance Metrics</h1>
    <p>Monitoring Kafka performance is crucial for maintaining high throughput and low latency. Kafka provides several metrics that can be used to monitor the performance of brokers, producers, consumers, and topics. These metrics are typically exposed via JMX (Java Management Extensions) or third-party monitoring tools like Prometheus and Grafana.</p>

    <h2>1. Key Kafka Metrics</h2>
    <p>The following are important Kafka performance metrics to monitor:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Messages In Per Second:</strong> The rate at which messages are produced to Kafka topics.</li>
        <li><strong>Bytes In/Out Per Second:</strong> The amount of data (in bytes) being written to and read from Kafka topics per second.</li>
        <li><strong>Under Replicated Partitions:</strong> The number of partitions that do not have the required number of replicas in sync. A high value indicates replication issues.</li>
        <li><strong>Consumer Lag:</strong> The difference between the latest offset in the partition and the offset of the consumer. High lag indicates slow consumers.</li>
        <li><strong>Request Latency:</strong> The time taken to process requests (e.g., produce or fetch) by Kafka brokers. This metric helps identify bottlenecks in the system.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Monitoring Kafka Metrics via JMX</h2>
    <p>Kafka exposes metrics via JMX, which can be accessed using monitoring tools like JConsole or Prometheus. To enable JMX monitoring, add the following configuration to your Kafka broker properties:</p>
    <pre><code>
# Enable JMX on Kafka broker
JMX_PORT=9999
    </code></pre>
    <p>You can then use JConsole or any JMX-compatible tool to connect to the broker's JMX server running on port 9999.</p>

    <h2>3. Common Kafka Metrics for Brokers</h2>
    <p>Below are some key Kafka broker metrics that you can monitor:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>kafka.server:type=BrokerTopicMetrics,name=MessagesInPerSec</strong> - Number of messages received per second.</li>
        <li><strong>kafka.network:type=RequestMetrics,name=RequestsPerSec,request=Produce</strong> - Number of produce requests per second.</li>
        <li><strong>kafka.server:type=ReplicaManager,name=UnderReplicatedPartitions</strong> - Number of under-replicated partitions.</li>
        <li><strong>kafka.server:type=KafkaRequestHandlerPool,name=RequestHandlerAvgIdlePercent</strong> - Percentage of time request handlers are idle.</li>
        <li><strong>kafka.network:type=RequestMetrics,name=RequestQueueTimeMs,request=FetchConsumer</strong> - Time spent in request queue by consumer fetch requests.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Monitoring Kafka Producer and Consumer Metrics</h2>
    <p>Producers and consumers expose metrics that are helpful to track performance. Some important metrics include:</p>

    <h3>Producer Metrics</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>record-send-rate:</strong> The rate at which records are sent to Kafka by the producer.</li>
        <li><strong>record-error-rate:</strong> The rate of record send errors.</li>
        <li><strong>request-latency-avg:</strong> The average latency of requests sent to Kafka by the producer.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Consumer Metrics</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>fetch-latency-avg:</strong> The average time taken by consumers to fetch records from Kafka.</li>
        <li><strong>records-consumed-rate:</strong> The rate at which records are consumed by the consumer.</li>
        <li><strong>fetch-rate:</strong> The number of fetch requests per second sent by the consumer to Kafka.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Example: Using Kafka Metrics in Prometheus</h2>
    <p>To monitor Kafka metrics in Prometheus, you can use <a href="https://github.com/danielqsj/kafka_exporter">Kafka Exporter</a> to expose metrics for Prometheus scraping. Hereâ€™s how to set it up:</p>
    <pre><code>
# Start Kafka Exporter with the following configuration
docker run -d --name=kafka-exporter \
    -e KAFKA_BROKERS=localhost:9092 \
    -p 9308:9308 \
    danielqsj/kafka-exporter
    </code></pre>
    <p>Once Kafka Exporter is running, Prometheus can scrape metrics from <code>localhost:9308/metrics</code> and visualize them using Grafana.</p>

    <h2>6. Best Practices for Kafka Monitoring</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Set up automated alerts for critical metrics like consumer lag, under-replicated partitions, and request latency.</li>
        <li>Use a centralized monitoring system such as Prometheus, Grafana, or Datadog to aggregate and visualize Kafka metrics.</li>
        <li>Monitor key broker, producer, and consumer metrics continuously to detect performance issues early.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7. Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Monitoring Kafka performance is essential for ensuring high availability, optimal throughput, and low latency. By tracking key metrics such as messages in/out, under-replicated partitions, and consumer lag, you can detect issues early and maintain a healthy Kafka cluster.</p>
