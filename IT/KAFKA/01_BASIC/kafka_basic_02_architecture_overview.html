    <h1>Apache Kafka Architecture Overview</h1>
    <p>Apache Kafka is designed with a distributed architecture to handle high-throughput, fault-tolerant, and scalable data streaming. The architecture consists of several key components that work together to provide a reliable messaging platform.</p>

    <h2>Key Components of Kafka Architecture</h2>

    <h3>1. Kafka Broker</h3>
    <p>A Kafka broker is a server that stores and serves data. It is responsible for handling data storage, retrieval, and replication. Kafka clusters are composed of multiple brokers, which work together to provide high availability and fault tolerance.</p>

        <p><em>Diagram: Kafka Broker</em></p>
    </div>

    <h3>2. Kafka Topic</h3>
    <p>A topic is a category or feed name to which records are sent. Topics are split into partitions to allow for parallel processing and scalability. Each partition is an ordered, immutable sequence of records.</p>

    </div>

    <h3>3. Kafka Partition</h3>
    <p>Each topic is divided into partitions, which are the basic unit of parallelism in Kafka. Partitions allow Kafka to scale horizontally by distributing data across multiple brokers and providing parallelism in data processing.</p>

    </div>

    <h3>4. Kafka Producer</h3>
    <p>Producers are applications that publish records to Kafka topics. Producers send records to the Kafka brokers, which then store them in the appropriate topic partitions. Producers can be configured to balance data across partitions for optimal performance.</p>

    </div>

    <h3>5. Kafka Consumer</h3>
    <p>Consumers are applications that read records from Kafka topics. Consumers subscribe to one or more topics and process the records. Consumers work within a consumer group, which allows multiple consumers to share the workload of processing records from a topic.</p>

    </div>

    <h3>6. Kafka Zookeeper</h3>
    <p>Zookeeper is a centralized service used by Kafka to manage and coordinate the Kafka brokers. It maintains metadata about the Kafka cluster, including information about brokers, topics, and partitions. Zookeeper is crucial for leader election and managing broker failures.</p>

    <h2>Kafka Architecture Diagram</h2>
    <p>The following diagram illustrates the overall architecture of a Kafka cluster, including brokers, topics, partitions, producers, consumers, and Zookeeper.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Apache Kafka's architecture is designed to provide high throughput, fault tolerance, and scalability. Understanding the roles of brokers, topics, partitions, producers, consumers, and Zookeeper is essential for building robust data streaming applications using Kafka.</p>
