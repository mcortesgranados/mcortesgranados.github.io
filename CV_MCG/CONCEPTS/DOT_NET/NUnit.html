    <h1>NUnit Overview</h1>

    <p>NUnit is a popular unit testing framework for .NET applications. It provides a simple and flexible way to write and execute tests, making it an essential tool for ensuring the correctness of code. NUnit supports various test attributes, assertions, and test runners, making it suitable for both simple and complex test scenarios.</p>

    <h2>Key Concepts</h2>

    <p><strong>1. Test Fixture:</strong> A test fixture is a class or a container for a set of related tests. It is marked with the <code>[TestFixture]</code> attribute in NUnit.</p>

    <p><strong>2. Test Case:</strong> A test case is a method within a test fixture that represents a specific test scenario. It is marked with the <code>[Test]</code> attribute.</p>

    <p><strong>3. Assertions:</strong> Assertions are used to verify the expected behavior of the code being tested. NUnit provides various assertion methods, such as <code>Assert.AreEqual</code> and <code>Assert.IsTrue</code>.</p>

    <p><strong>4. Test Runners:</strong> Test runners are tools or utilities that discover and execute NUnit tests. Examples include the NUnit console runner, NUnit GUI runner, and integration with Visual Studio.</p>

    <p><strong>5. SetUp and TearDown:</strong> <code>[SetUp]</code> and <code>[TearDown]</code> attributes are used to mark methods that are executed before and after each test case, respectively. They help in setting up and cleaning up test resources.</p>

    <h2>Technical Interview Questions</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>What is NUnit?</strong>
            <p>NUnit is a unit testing framework for .NET applications. It provides a simple and flexible way to write and execute tests to ensure the correctness of code.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Explain the concept of Test Fixture in NUnit.</strong>
            <p>A test fixture in NUnit is a class or container for a set of related tests. It is marked with the <code>[TestFixture]</code> attribute and may contain multiple test cases.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>What is a Test Case in NUnit?</strong>
            <p>A test case in NUnit is a method within a test fixture that represents a specific test scenario. It is marked with the <code>[Test]</code> attribute and contains assertions to verify the expected behavior.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Explain the purpose of the [SetUp] and [TearDown] attributes in NUnit.</strong>
            <p>The <code>[SetUp]</code> attribute in NUnit marks a method that is executed before each test case, allowing the setup of necessary resources. The <code>[TearDown]</code> attribute marks a method that is executed after each test case for cleanup.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>What are Assertions in NUnit?</strong>
            <p>Assertions in NUnit are used to verify the expected behavior of the code being tested. NUnit provides various assertion methods, such as <code>Assert.AreEqual</code>, <code>Assert.IsTrue</code>, and others.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Explain the significance of the [Test] attribute in NUnit.</strong>
            <p>The <code>[Test]</code> attribute in NUnit marks a method as a test case. When a test runner discovers this attribute, it executes the method as part of the test suite.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>How do you group tests in NUnit?</strong>
            <p>Tests in NUnit can be grouped using the <code>[TestFixture]</code> attribute. Each test fixture contains one or more test cases, and the fixtures themselves provide a way to organize and categorize tests.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>What is the role of the NUnit console runner?</strong>
            <p>The NUnit console runner is a command-line tool that discovers and executes NUnit tests. It is particularly useful for automated build processes and continuous integration environments.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Explain the concept of parameterized tests in NUnit.</strong>
            <p>Parameterized tests in NUnit allow the execution of the same test logic with different sets of input parameters. This is achieved using the <code>[TestCase]</code> attribute or other attributes supporting parameterization.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>How does NUnit support asynchronous tests?</strong>
            <p>NUnit supports asynchronous tests using the <code>[Test]</code> attribute with an <code>async</code> method. The test runner automatically awaits the asynchronous operations, allowing for asynchronous test scenarios.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Explain the purpose of the Assert.AreEqual method in NUnit.</strong>
            <p>The <code>Assert.AreEqual</code> method in NUnit is used to verify that two values are equal. It compares the expected and actual values and fails the test if they are not equal.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>What is the role of the NUnit GUI runner?</strong>
            <p>The NUnit GUI runner is a graphical user interface for discovering and executing NUnit tests. It provides a visual representation of test results and allows developers to interactively run and debug tests.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>How do you handle expected exceptions in NUnit?</strong>
            <p>Expected exceptions in NUnit can be handled using the <code>[Test]</code> attribute with the <code>ExpectedException</code> property or the <code>Assert.Throws</code> method. These approaches allow for specifying and asserting the occurrence of exceptions.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Explain the concept of TestCaseSource in NUnit.</strong>
            <p>TestCaseSource in NUnit is used to provide sets of test cases from a property, method, or field. It allows for parameterizing tests with various input values.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>How do you mark a test as ignored in NUnit?</strong>
            <p>A test can be marked as ignored in NUnit using the <code>[Ignore]</code> attribute. This signals the test runner to skip the test during execution.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Explain the use of the Assert.IsFalse method in NUnit.</strong>
            <p>The <code>Assert.IsFalse</code> method in NUnit is used to verify that a specified condition is false. It fails the test if the condition is true.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>What is the purpose of the TestCase attribute in NUnit?</strong>
            <p>The <code>TestCase</code> attribute in NUnit is used to define parameterized tests. It allows you to specify different sets of input parameters for a test method.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>How can you run a subset of tests in NUnit?</strong>
            <p>In NUnit, you can run a subset of tests by using the <code>--test</code> option with the NUnit console runner or by selectively running tests in the GUI runner. Test filtering options allow developers to execute specific tests or test fixtures.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Explain the concept of test categories in NUnit.</strong>
            <p>Test categories in NUnit provide a way to categorize tests based on attributes. This allows for the selective execution of tests belonging to specific categories using the test runner.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>How do you write a parameterized test in NUnit using the TestCase attribute?</strong>
            <p>To write a parameterized test in NUnit using the <code>TestCase</code> attribute, you annotate a test method and provide values for its parameters using the attribute constructor. The test method is then executed for each set of parameter values.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>What is the purpose of the Assert.IsNull method in NUnit?</strong>
            <p>The <code>Assert.IsNull</code> method in NUnit is used to verify that a specified object reference is null. It fails the test if the object reference is not null.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>How do you run NUnit tests in Visual Studio?</strong>
            <p>In Visual Studio, NUnit tests can be run using the NUnit Test Adapter. After installing the adapter, the NUnit tests can be discovered and executed through the Visual Studio Test Explorer.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Explain the purpose of the Assert.Pass and Assert.Fail methods in NUnit.</strong>
            <p>The <code>Assert.Pass</code> method in NUnit is used to explicitly mark a test as passed. The <code>Assert.Fail</code> method is used to explicitly mark a test as failed. These methods provide control over test outcomes.</p>
