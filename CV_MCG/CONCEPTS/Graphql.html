    <h1>GraphQL</h1>

    <p>
        GraphQL is a query language for APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) and a runtime for executing those queries with your existing data. It was developed by Facebook and later open-sourced. GraphQL provides a more efficient, powerful, and flexible alternative to traditional REST APIs, enabling clients to request only the data they need.
    </p>

    <h2>Key Features:</h2>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Declarative Data Fetching:</strong> Clients can specify the shape and structure of the response they need, reducing over-fetching or under-fetching of data.</li>
        <li><strong>Single Request:</strong> Clients can retrieve all the needed data in a single request, avoiding multiple round-trips to the server.</li>
        <li><strong>Strong Typing:</strong> GraphQL uses a type system to define the structure of data, providing a clear contract between the client and the server.</li>
        <li><strong>Real-time Updates:</strong> GraphQL subscriptions allow clients to receive real-time updates when data changes on the server.</li>
        <li><strong>Introspection:</strong> GraphQL provides introspective capabilities, allowing clients to query the schema and discover available types and operations.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Components:</h2>

    <p>
        The main components of a GraphQL system include:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Schema:</strong> A GraphQL schema defines the types and relationships of the data that can be queried. It serves as a contract between the client and the server.</li>
        <li><strong>Queries:</strong> Clients use GraphQL queries to request specific data from the server, specifying the fields and structure of the response.</li>
        <li><strong>Mutations:</strong> Mutations are used to modify data on the server, such as creating, updating, or deleting records.</li>
        <li><strong>Subscriptions:</strong> GraphQL subscriptions enable real-time communication between clients and servers, allowing clients to receive updates when relevant data changes.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Usage:</h2>

    <p>
        GraphQL is commonly used in scenarios where efficient data fetching, strong typing, and real-time updates are important. It is suitable for a wide range of applications, including web and mobile development, APIs for third-party integrations, and data-driven applications.
