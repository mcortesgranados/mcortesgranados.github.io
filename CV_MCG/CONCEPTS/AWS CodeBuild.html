  <h1>AWS CodeBuild</h1>

  <p>AWS CodeBuild is a fully managed continuous integration service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS). It is designed to compile source code, run tests, and produce software packages that are ready to deploy. CodeBuild eliminates the need to set up, configure, and scale your own build servers.</p>

  <h2>Key Features and Concepts:</h2>

  <ol>
    <li><strong>Build Environments:</strong> CodeBuild provides pre-configured build environments that support various programming languages and runtime environments.</li>
    <li><strong>Build Specifications:</strong> Builds in CodeBuild are defined by build specifications, which are YAML-formatted files specifying the build environment, source code location, build commands, and other settings.</li>
    <li><strong>Source Code Integration:</strong> CodeBuild integrates with popular source code repositories such as AWS CodeCommit, GitHub, and Bitbucket.</li>
    <li><strong>Build Triggers:</strong> Builds can be triggered automatically or manually initiated. CodeBuild can also integrate with AWS CodePipeline for a more comprehensive CI/CD solution.</li>
    <li><strong>Artifacts:</strong> After a build is complete, CodeBuild produces artifacts, which are the output files or packages generated during the build process.</li>
    <li><strong>Custom Build Environments:</strong> CodeBuild allows creating custom build environments with specific configurations and dependencies.</li>
    <li><strong>Logs and Reports:</strong> CodeBuild generates detailed logs that provide insights into the build process.</li>
    <li><strong>Scaling:</strong> CodeBuild can automatically scale to handle multiple builds concurrently.</li>
    <li><strong>Pricing:</strong> CodeBuild pricing is based on the number of build minutes used.</li>
    <li><strong>Security:</strong> CodeBuild integrates with AWS IAM to control access to build projects and resources.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>AWS CodeBuild is a key component in many CI/CD pipelines on AWS, and its integration with other AWS services makes it a versatile tool for automating the build and deployment process.</p>
