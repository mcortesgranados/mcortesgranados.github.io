<h1>Apache Airflow</h1>

  <p>Apache Airflow is an open-source platform used to programmatically author, schedule, and monitor workflows. It allows users to define workflows as code, making it easy to create, manage, and monitor complex data pipelines. Key features of Apache Airflow include:</p>

  <h2>1. Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs):</h2>
  <p>Airflow represents workflows as DAGs, which are directed acyclic graphs. DAGs define the sequence of tasks and their dependencies, making it easy to visualize and understand the workflow logic.</p>

  <h2>2. Extensible:</h2>
  <p>Airflow is extensible, allowing users to define custom operators, sensors, and hooks to integrate with various systems and services. This extensibility makes it suitable for a wide range of use cases.</p>

  <h2>3. Dynamic Workflow Configuration:</h2>
  <p>Workflows in Airflow can be parameterized, allowing for dynamic configuration. This flexibility enables the reuse of workflow definitions with different parameters.</p>

  <h2>4. Scheduler:</h2>
  <p>The Airflow scheduler executes tasks based on their dependencies and schedules. It ensures that tasks are run in the correct order and according to the specified schedule.</p>

  <h2>5. Web UI:</h2>
  <p>Airflow provides a web-based user interface that allows users to monitor and visualize the status of DAGs, view task logs, and trigger manual executions. The UI enhances the overall user experience.</p>

  <h2>6. Operators:</h2>
  <p>Operators define the execution logic of tasks within a DAG. Airflow includes a variety of built-in operators for common tasks, and users can create custom operators to suit specific needs.</p>

  <h2>7. Task Dependencies:</h2>
  <p>Airflow allows users to define dependencies between tasks, ensuring that tasks are executed in the correct order. Tasks can depend on the success, failure, or completion of other tasks.</p>

  <h2>8. Integration with External Systems:</h2>
  <p>Airflow can integrate with various external systems and services, such as databases, cloud platforms, and messaging queues, making it a versatile tool for orchestrating workflows across different environments.</p>

  <h2>9. Logging and Monitoring:</h2>
  <p>Airflow provides logging and monitoring capabilities, allowing users to track the progress of tasks, troubleshoot issues, and monitor the overall health of workflows.</p>

  <h2>10. Community and Ecosystem:</h2>
  <p>Being an open-source project, Apache Airflow has a vibrant community and a rich ecosystem of plugins and extensions. This community support contributes to the platform's continuous improvement and adoption.</p>

  <p>Apache Airflow is widely used for data engineering, ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes, and automation of complex workflows in various industries.</p>
