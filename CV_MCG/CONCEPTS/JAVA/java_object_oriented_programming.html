    <h1>Java Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) FAQ</h1>

    <h2>1. Explain the principles of OOP: Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, and Abstraction.</h2>
    <p>
        The core principles of OOP are:
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Encapsulation:</strong> Encapsulation restricts access to certain components of an object to protect its state and behavior.</li>
            <li><strong>Inheritance:</strong> Inheritance allows one class (child) to inherit properties and methods from another class (parent), promoting code reuse.</li>
            <li><strong>Polymorphism:</strong> Polymorphism enables objects to be treated as instances of their parent class, allowing for flexibility in method execution.</li>
            <li><strong>Abstraction:</strong> Abstraction hides complex implementation details and provides a simplified interface to interact with objects.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>2. What is the difference between a class and an object in Java?</h2>
    <p>
        A <strong>class</strong> is a blueprint that defines properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods) of objects, while an <strong>object</strong> is an instance of a class created in memory that holds specific values for its attributes.
    </p>

    <h2>3. What is an abstract class, and when would you use it instead of an interface?</h2>
    <p>
        An <strong>abstract class</strong> can have both abstract methods (without implementation) and concrete methods (with implementation). It is used when classes share a common base but have unique implementations. Use it over an interface when default implementations or state are needed.
    </p>

    <h2>4. What is the difference between method overloading and method overriding? When would you use each?</h2>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Method Overloading:</strong> Overloading occurs when methods in the same class have the same name but different parameter lists. It is useful for creating variations of a method with different input requirements.</li>
            <li><strong>Method Overriding:</strong> Overriding occurs when a subclass provides a specific implementation of a method already defined in its superclass. Use it to provide specific behavior in the subclass.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>5. How do you implement polymorphism in Java? Provide an example.</h2>
    <p>
        Polymorphism in Java is implemented through method overriding and interfaces. Example:
        <pre>
interface Animal {
    void makeSound();
}

class Dog implements Animal {
    public void makeSound() { System.out.println("Bark"); }
}

class Cat implements Animal {
    public void makeSound() { System.out.println("Meow"); }
}

Animal animal = new Dog();
animal.makeSound();  // Output: Bark
        </pre>
    </p>

    <h2>6. What are access modifiers (public, private, protected)? When is it appropriate to use them?</h2>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Public:</strong> Accessible from any class.</li>
            <li><strong>Private:</strong> Accessible only within the declared class. Used for hiding implementation details.</li>
            <li><strong>Protected:</strong> Accessible within the same package or by subclasses. Useful for allowing inheritance with restricted access.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>7. How message passing over methods works in Java (pass-by-value, pass-by-reference)</h2>
    <p>
        Java uses <strong>pass-by-value</strong>. For primitives, the value is passed, while for objects, the reference to the object is passed by value. This means changes to object fields are reflected outside the method, but reassigning the object itself does not affect the original reference.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Do you consider that returning null from a method is good practice?</h2>
    <p>
        Returning <code>null</code> from a method can lead to <code>NullPointerException</code> if not handled properly. It's often better to return <code>Optional</code> (Java 8+) or empty collections instead of <code>null</code> to avoid errors.
    </p>

    <h1>Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Interview Questions & Answers</h1>

    <h2>1. What is a constructor in Java?</h2>
    <p>A constructor in Java is a block of code used to initialize an object when it is created. It has the same name as the class and does not have a return type.</p>

    <h2>2. What is the purpose of the `super` keyword in Java?</h2>
    <p>The `super` keyword is used to refer to the superclass of the current object. It can be used to call the superclass constructor or methods, or to access fields.</p>

    <h2>3. What is the difference between `==` and `.equals()` in Java?</h2>
    <p>`==` compares the memory reference (whether two references point to the same object in memory), while `.equals()` compares the actual contents of two objects.</p>

    <h2>4. What is the difference between `String` and `StringBuilder` in Java?</h2>
    <p>`String` is immutable, meaning once created, its value cannot be changed. `StringBuilder` is mutable, allowing modification of the string value.</p>

    <h2>5. What is the `final` keyword in Java?</h2>
    <p>The `final` keyword in Java can be used to define constants, prevent method overriding, or prevent inheritance of a class.</p>

    <h2>6. Explain method overriding in Java.</h2>
    <p>Method overriding occurs when a subclass provides a specific implementation for a method that is already defined in its superclass.</p>

    <h2>7. What is the difference between an interface and an abstract class in Java?</h2>
    <p>An interface can only declare abstract methods (until Java 8, when default methods were introduced), and a class can implement multiple interfaces. An abstract class can have both abstract and concrete methods, and a class can inherit only one abstract class.</p>

    <h2>8. What is a singleton class in Java?</h2>
    <p>A singleton class is a design pattern that restricts the instantiation of a class to one object. It ensures that only one instance of the class is created during the application lifecycle.</p>

    <h2>9. What are the differences between `ArrayList` and `LinkedList` in Java?</h2>
    <p>`ArrayList` uses a dynamic array for storage, allowing for faster random access but slower insertions and deletions. `LinkedList` uses a doubly linked list, allowing for faster insertions and deletions but slower random access.</p>

    <h2>10. What are abstract methods in Java?</h2>
    <p>Abstract methods are methods that are declared without an implementation in an abstract class or interface. They must be implemented by subclasses of the abstract class or by a class implementing the interface.</p>

    <h2>11. What is the role of the `this` keyword in Java?</h2>
    <p>The `this` keyword refers to the current instance of the class, helping differentiate instance variables from local variables or parameters.</p>

    <h2>12. What is a `package` in Java?</h2>
    <p>A package in Java is a namespace that organizes classes and interfaces, allowing for easier code management and avoiding naming conflicts.</p>

    <h2>13. What is the difference between `throw` and `throws` in Java?</h2>
    <p>`throw` is used to explicitly throw an exception, while `throws` is used in a method signature to declare that a method may throw one or more exceptions.</p>

    <h2>14. What is a static method in Java?</h2>
    <p>A static method belongs to the class rather than instances of the class. It can be called without creating an object of the class.</p>

    <h2>15. Explain the difference between `interface` and `abstract class`.</h2>
    <p>An `interface` defines abstract methods that must be implemented by a class, while an `abstract class` can have both abstract and concrete methods. An interface can be implemented by multiple classes, but a class can inherit only one abstract class.</p>

    <h2>16. What is polymorphism in Java?</h2>
    <p>Polymorphism allows an object to take many forms. In Java, it is typically achieved through method overriding (runtime polymorphism) and method overloading (compile-time polymorphism).</p>

    <h2>17. What are the types of polymorphism in Java?</h2>
    <p>There are two types of polymorphism in Java: compile-time (method overloading) and runtime (method overriding).</p>

    <h2>18. How does garbage collection work in Java?</h2>
    <p>Garbage collection is the process of automatically reclaiming memory that is no longer in use, performed by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). It frees memory used by unreachable objects.</p>

    <h2>19. What is the purpose of the `transient` keyword in Java?</h2>
    <p>The `transient` keyword is used to indicate that a field should not be serialized. When an object is serialized, transient fields are not included in the serialization process.</p>

    <h2>20. What is the purpose of the `volatile` keyword in Java?</h2>
    <p>The `volatile` keyword is used to indicate that a variableâ€™s value will be changed by multiple threads. It ensures that changes to the variable are visible to all threads.</p>

    <h2>21. What is the difference between `equals()` and `hashCode()` methods in Java?</h2>
    <p>The `equals()` method is used to compare the contents of two objects, while `hashCode()` returns an integer hash code that represents the object in a hash-based collection like `HashMap`.</p>

    <h2>22. What is the difference between `synchronized` and `concurrent` collections in Java?</h2>
    <p>The `synchronized` keyword is used to make methods or blocks of code thread-safe, while `concurrent` collections (e.g., `ConcurrentHashMap`) are designed to provide better concurrency performance without the need for explicit synchronization.</p>

    <h2>23. How can you prevent inheritance in Java?</h2>
    <p>In Java, inheritance can be prevented by using the `final` keyword on a class. A `final` class cannot be extended.</p>

    <h2>24. What is the difference between `List`, `Set`, and `Map` in Java?</h2>
    <p>A `List` is an ordered collection that allows duplicates, a `Set` is an unordered collection that does not allow duplicates, and a `Map` is a collection of key-value pairs.</p>

    <h2>25. What is a `default` method in Java interfaces?</h2>
    <p>A `default` method is a method in an interface with a default implementation. It allows the addition of methods to interfaces without breaking existing implementations.</p>

    <h2>26. What is method overloading?</h2>
    <p>Method overloading occurs when multiple methods in a class have the same name but different parameters (number, type, or order of parameters).</p>

    <h2>27. What is the difference between a `static` and a `non-static` method?</h2>
    <p>A `static` method belongs to the class and can be called without an object, while a `non-static` method belongs to an instance of the class and requires an object to be called.</p>

    <h2>28. What is the purpose of the `instanceof` operator in Java?</h2>
    <p>The `instanceof` operator is used to check if an object is an instance of a particular class or implements a particular interface.</p>

    <h2>29. What are the benefits of OOP?</h2>
    <p>Benefits of OOP include modularity, reusability, scalability, maintainability, and the ability to create complex systems with easily understandable components.</p>

    <h2>30. Can an abstract class be instantiated in Java?</h2>
    <p>No, an abstract class cannot be instantiated directly. It must be subclassed, and the subclass must provide implementations for all abstract methods.</p>
