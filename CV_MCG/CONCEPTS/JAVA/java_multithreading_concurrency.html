    <h1>Multithreading and Concurrency in Java</h1>

    <h2>1. What is a thread in Java, and how do you create one?</h2>
    <p>A thread in Java is a lightweight process that allows the execution of code in parallel with other threads. It is the smallest unit of execution within a Java application. You can create a thread in Java by either implementing the <code>Runnable</code> interface or by extending the <code>Thread</code> class.</p>
    <p><strong>Example using <code>Runnable</code>:</strong></p>
    <pre><code>
class MyRunnable implements Runnable {
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Running in a thread.");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyRunnable myRunnable = new MyRunnable();
        Thread thread = new Thread(myRunnable);
        thread.start();
    }
}
    </code></pre>

    <h2>2. What is the difference between Runnable and Thread?</h2>
    <p><strong>Runnable:</strong> An interface that contains a single method <code>run()</code>, which is meant to define the code to be executed by the thread.</p>
    <p><strong>Thread:</strong> A class that represents an actual thread of execution. It implements the <code>Runnable</code> interface and provides additional methods for thread management, such as <code>start()</code>, <code>join()</code>, and others.</p>

    <h2>3. What is thread synchronization? When would you use a synchronized block?</h2>
    <p>Thread synchronization is a mechanism that ensures that only one thread can access a critical section of code at a time. This is necessary when multiple threads are modifying shared resources, to avoid inconsistent or corrupted data.</p>
    <p><strong>When to use synchronized block:</strong> You would use a synchronized block to control access to a particular piece of code that should not be accessed concurrently by multiple threads. This is useful for preventing race conditions.</p>
    <pre><code>
synchronized (object) {
    // critical section
}
    </code></pre>

    <h2>4. What is a deadlock in Java, and how can you avoid it?</h2>
    <p>A deadlock occurs when two or more threads are blocked forever because they are waiting for each other to release resources. For example, if thread A holds lock X and is waiting for lock Y, and thread B holds lock Y and is waiting for lock X, both threads will be stuck in a circular dependency.</p>
    <p><strong>How to avoid deadlock:</strong> 
        <ul>
            <li>Use a consistent locking order (i.e., always acquire locks in the same order).</li>
            <li>Use try-lock mechanisms with a timeout, such as <code>ReentrantLock.tryLock()</code>.</li>
            <li>Avoid holding locks for a long time and reduce the scope of synchronized blocks.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>5. What are ExecutorService and Callable? How do you use them to manage concurrency?</h2>
    <p><strong>ExecutorService:</strong> An interface that provides a higher-level replacement for the <code>Thread</code> class and <code>Runnable</code> interface. It provides methods for managing and controlling thread execution, such as <code>submit()</code> and <code>shutdown()</code>.</p>
    <p><strong>Callable:</strong> Similar to <code>Runnable</code>, but can return a result or throw an exception. The <code>submit()</code> method in <code>ExecutorService</code> can accept a <code>Callable</code> task.</p>
    <pre><code>
ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(2);
Callable<Integer> task = new Callable<Integer>() {
    public Integer call() {
        return 123;
    }
};
Future<Integer> result = executor.submit(task);
Integer value = result.get(); // returns 123
executor.shutdown();
    </code></pre>

    <h2>6. Can you tell the difference between synchronized and volatile in Java?</h2>
    <p><strong>synchronized:</strong> The <code>synchronized</code> keyword is used to make sure that only one thread can execute a particular block of code at a time, ensuring thread safety. It guarantees mutual exclusion by locking the object or method.</p>
    <p><strong>volatile:</strong> The <code>volatile</code> keyword is used to indicate that a variable's value may be changed by multiple threads. It ensures that the most up-to-date value of the variable is always visible to all threads, but it does not guarantee mutual exclusion. It is typically used for flags or state variables shared between threads.</p>
    <pre><code>
private volatile boolean flag = false; // flag that can be updated by multiple threads
    </code></pre>


    <h1>Multithreading and Concurrency in Java - 30 Questions and Answers</h1>

    <h2>1. What is the difference between a thread and a process?</h2>
    <p>A <strong>thread</strong> is a smaller unit of a process that shares the same memory space. A <strong>process</strong> is an independent program in execution, and threads within the same process share resources like memory.</p>

    <h2>2. What is the lifecycle of a thread in Java?</h2>
    <p>The lifecycle of a thread includes the following states:
        <ul>
            <li><strong>New:</strong> When a thread is created but not yet started.</li>
            <li><strong>Runnable:</strong> When the thread is ready for execution, but the OS may or may not be running it.</li>
            <li><strong>Blocked:</strong> When the thread is blocked from executing due to some condition, like waiting for a resource.</li>
            <li><strong>Waiting:</strong> When the thread is waiting for another thread to perform a specific action.</li>
            <li><strong>Terminated:</strong> When the thread has completed its execution or was terminated.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>3. What is the difference between <code>sleep()</code> and <code>wait()</code> in Java?</h2>
    <p><code>sleep()</code> is a static method of the <code>Thread</code> class that pauses the current thread for a specified period of time, without releasing any locks. In contrast, <code>wait()</code> is an instance method of <code>Object</code> that causes the current thread to release the lock and wait until another thread notifies it.</p>

    <h2>4. How do you start a thread in Java?</h2>
    <p>To start a thread, you can either create an instance of the <code>Thread</code> class and call its <code>start()</code> method, or create a <code>Runnable</code> object and pass it to a <code>Thread</code> object, then call <code>start()</code> on the <code>Thread</code> object.</p>
    <pre><code>
Thread t = new Thread(() -> { System.out.println("Thread started"); });
t.start();
    </code></pre>

    <h2>5. What is the significance of <code>join()</code> method in Java?</h2>
    <p>The <code>join()</code> method allows one thread to wait for the completion of another thread. When called, the current thread pauses execution until the thread on which <code>join()</code> was called finishes.</p>
    <pre><code>
Thread t = new Thread(() -> { /* some task */ });
t.start();
t.join(); // Main thread waits for t to finish
    </code></pre>

    <h2>6. How can you interrupt a thread in Java?</h2>
    <p>You can interrupt a thread by calling the <code>interrupt()</code> method on the thread. This sets the thread's interrupt flag. If the thread is blocked in a method like <code>wait()</code> or <code>sleep()</code>, it will throw an <code>InterruptedException</code>.</p>
    <pre><code>
Thread t = new Thread(() -> { /* some task */ });
t.start();
t.interrupt();
    </code></pre>

    <h2>7. What is the <code>ThreadPoolExecutor</code> in Java?</h2>
    <p><code>ThreadPoolExecutor</code> is a class that manages a pool of worker threads and assigns tasks to them. It helps to improve performance by reusing existing threads rather than creating new ones every time a task is submitted.</p>

    <h2>8. What is the purpose of <code>ReentrantLock</code> in Java?</h2>
    <p><code>ReentrantLock</code> is a lock implementation that provides more advanced lock management capabilities, such as the ability to interrupt a thread while it is waiting to acquire a lock, and the ability to try locking a resource without blocking.</p>

    <h2>9. What is a <code>CountDownLatch</code> in Java?</h2>
    <p>A <code>CountDownLatch</code> is a synchronization aid that allows one or more threads to wait until a set of operations being performed by other threads completes. It is initialized with a count, and each thread calls <code>countDown()</code> when it finishes its task. Threads waiting on the latch are released when the count reaches zero.</p>

    <h2>10. What is a <code>Semaphore</code> in Java?</h2>
    <p>A <code>Semaphore</code> is a synchronization object used to control access to a shared resource by multiple threads. It maintains a set of permits, and each thread must acquire a permit before accessing the shared resource.</p>

    <h2>11. What is the <code>ForkJoinPool</code> in Java?</h2>
    <p><code>ForkJoinPool</code> is a special type of thread pool designed for parallel tasks that can be recursively split into smaller tasks. It is particularly useful for divide-and-conquer algorithms.</p>

    <h2>12. What is the <code>AtomicInteger</code> class in Java?</h2>
    <p><code>AtomicInteger</code> is a class that provides atomic operations on an <code>int</code> value. It is part of the <code>java.util.concurrent.atomic</code> package and is useful when multiple threads need to update a variable without using synchronization.</p>

    <h2>13. What is the <code>ExecutorService</code> in Java?</h2>
    <p><code>ExecutorService</code> is an interface that provides methods for managing and controlling the execution of tasks asynchronously. Common implementations include <code>ThreadPoolExecutor</code> and <code>ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor</code>.</p>

    <h2>14. What is the difference between <code>Callable</code> and <code>Runnable</code>?</h2>
    <p><code>Callable</code> is similar to <code>Runnable</code>, but it can return a result and throw an exception. In contrast, <code>Runnable</code> does not return any result and cannot throw exceptions.</p>

    <h2>15. What is the <code>volatile</code> keyword used for in Java?</h2>
    <p>The <code>volatile</code> keyword ensures that a variable's value is always visible to all threads. It prevents the value from being cached in registers or local memory, which could lead to inconsistent behavior in multithreaded programs.</p>

    <h2>16. What is a <code>ThreadLocal</code> variable in Java?</h2>
    <p>A <code>ThreadLocal</code> variable is a variable that is local to each thread. Each thread accessing a <code>ThreadLocal</code> variable gets its own independent copy, which is not shared with other threads.</p>

    <h2>17. What is the <code>ReentrantReadWriteLock</code> in Java?</h2>
    <p><code>ReentrantReadWriteLock</code> is a lock that allows multiple readers to access a resource simultaneously, but only one writer can access the resource at a time. It is useful in scenarios where reads are frequent and writes are less frequent.</p>

    <h2>18. What is a <code>Future</code> in Java?</h2>
    <p><code>Future</code> represents the result of an asynchronous computation. It provides methods like <code>get()</code> to retrieve the result once the task is complete, or to handle exceptions thrown during execution.</p>

    <h2>19. What is the <code>ExecutorService.submit()</code> method used for?</h2>
    <p>The <code>submit()</code> method submits a task for execution by an <code>ExecutorService</code>. It returns a <code>Future</code> object that can be used to retrieve the result of the computation.</p>

    <h2>20. What is the <code>notify()</code> method in Java?</h2>
    <p>The <code>notify()</code> method is used to wake up a single thread that is waiting on an object. This is typically used in a synchronized block or method to notify other threads that they can proceed.</p>

    <h2>21. What is the <code>join()</code> method used for in Java?</h2>
    <p>The <code>join()</code> method allows one thread to wait for the completion of another thread. It ensures that the calling thread will pause until the thread it is called on finishes.</p>

    <h2>22. How do you create a thread-safe collection in Java?</h2>
    <p>Java provides thread-safe collections in the <code>java.util.concurrent</code> package, such as <code>CopyOnWriteArrayList</code> and <code>ConcurrentHashMap</code>, which handle synchronization internally.</p>

    <h2>23. What is the difference between synchronized methods and synchronized blocks in Java?</h2>
    <p>Synchronized methods lock the entire method, whereas synchronized blocks allow finer control over which part of the code is locked, allowing multiple threads to execute other parts of the method concurrently.</p>

    <h2>24. What are deadlocks in Java?</h2>
    <p>A deadlock occurs when two or more threads are blocked forever, waiting for each other to release a resource. This can happen if threads hold locks and attempt to acquire locks that other threads hold.</p>

    <h2>25. How can you avoid deadlocks in Java?</h2>
    <p>To avoid deadlocks, ensure that threads acquire locks in a consistent order, use timeouts for locking attempts, or use higher-level concurrency utilities like <code>ReentrantLock</code> that can try to acquire a lock without blocking indefinitely.</p>

    <h2>26. What is the <code>ExecutorService.invokeAll()</code> method used for?</h2>
    <p>The <code>invokeAll()</code> method executes a collection of tasks and blocks until all of them have finished. It returns a list of <code>Future</code> objects for each task.</p>

    <h2>27. What is the <code>Executors.newFixedThreadPool()</code> method?</h2>
    <p><code>Executors.newFixedThreadPool()</code> creates a thread pool with a fixed number of threads. It is useful when you have a known number of tasks and want to reuse a fixed number of threads for performance.</p>

    <h2>28. What is the <code>Thread.sleep()</code> method?</h2>
    <p><code>Thread.sleep()</code> is used to pause the execution of the current thread for a specified amount of time. It does not release any locks.</p>

    <h2>29. What is a <code>Phaser</code> in Java?</h2>
    <p>A <code>Phaser</code> is a synchronization barrier that allows threads to wait for each other at different phases of a task. Each phase can have an arbitrary number of threads participating in it.</p>

    <h2>30. How can you use <code>CompletableFuture</code> for asynchronous programming in Java?</h2>
    <p><code>CompletableFuture</code> allows you to write non-blocking, asynchronous code by chaining multiple tasks and providing completion handlers that are executed once the task is done.</p>
