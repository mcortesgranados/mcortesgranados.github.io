<p>
        Amazon DocumentDB is a fully managed NoSQL database service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that is compatible with MongoDB. It is designed to provide the performance, scalability, and availability of a high-end NoSQL database while preserving the querying and indexing capabilities of MongoDB.    </p>
