  <h1>Regression Machine Learning Model</h1>

  <p>Regression is a type of supervised machine learning technique used for predicting a continuous outcome variable based on one or more predictor variables. In regression models, the goal is to establish a relationship between the input features and the target variable. Here are key aspects of regression machine learning models:</p>

  <h2>1. Objective:</h2>
  <p>The primary objective of regression is to model the relationship between the independent variables (features) and the dependent variable (target) in a way that allows making predictions or understanding the underlying patterns in the data.</p>

  <h2>2. Types of Regression:</h2>
  <p>There are various types of regression models, including:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Linear Regression:</strong> Assumes a linear relationship between the features and the target variable.</li>
    <li><strong>Polynomial Regression:</strong> Allows for modeling non-linear relationships using polynomial functions.</li>
    <li><strong>Ridge Regression:</strong> Adds a regularization term to linear regression to prevent overfitting.</li>
    <li><strong>Lasso Regression:</strong> Uses a different regularization term, promoting sparsity in the model coefficients.</li>
    <li><strong>Support Vector Regression (SVR):</strong> Applies the principles of support vector machines to regression problems.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Model Training:</h2>
  <p>The process of training a regression model involves finding the optimal parameters (coefficients) that minimize the difference between the predicted values and the actual values of the target variable in the training dataset. This is often done using optimization algorithms.</p>

  <h2>4. Evaluation Metrics:</h2>
  <p>Common evaluation metrics for regression models include Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R-squared. These metrics quantify the performance of the model in terms of prediction accuracy.</p>

  <h2>5. Assumptions:</h2>
  <p>Linear regression models, in particular, rely on certain assumptions such as linearity, independence of errors, homoscedasticity, and normality of errors. Violations of these assumptions can impact the model's performance and interpretation.</p>

  <h2>6. Feature Engineering:</h2>
  <p>Feature engineering plays a crucial role in regression models. It involves selecting relevant features, handling missing data, scaling features, and creating new features that may enhance the model's predictive capabilities.</p>

  <h2>7. Overfitting and Underfitting:</h2>
  <p>Regression models should strike a balance between overfitting and underfitting. Overfitting occurs when the model captures noise in the training data, while underfitting arises when the model is too simplistic to capture the underlying patterns. Regularization techniques can help address these issues.</p>

  <h2>8. Deployment:</h2>
  <p>Once trained and evaluated, a regression model can be deployed for making predictions on new, unseen data. Deployment may involve integrating the model into a production system or using it in real-time applications.</p>

  <p>Regression models are widely used in various domains, including finance, economics, healthcare, and engineering, for tasks such as predicting stock prices, estimating sales, and forecasting trends based on historical data.</p>
