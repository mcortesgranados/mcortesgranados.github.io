<h1>Apache Hadoop</h1>

  <p>Apache Hadoop is an open-source framework designed for the distributed storage and processing of large datasets. It provides a scalable and fault-tolerant solution for big data processing. Key components of the Hadoop ecosystem include:</p>

  <h2>1. Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS):</h2>
  <p>HDFS is a distributed file system that stores data across multiple nodes in a Hadoop cluster. It provides high throughput and fault tolerance, making it suitable for storing large volumes of data.</p>

  <h2>2. MapReduce:</h2>
  <p>MapReduce is a programming model and processing engine for distributed data processing. It breaks down tasks into smaller map and reduce operations, enabling the parallel processing of data across a Hadoop cluster.</p>

  <h2>3. YARN (Yet Another Resource Negotiator):</h2>
  <p>YARN is a resource management layer that allows multiple data processing engines, such as MapReduce, Apache Spark, and Apache Flink, to share resources in a Hadoop cluster. It optimizes resource utilization and improves cluster efficiency.</p>

  <h2>4. Apache Hive:</h2>
  <p>Hive is a data warehousing and SQL-like query language for Hadoop. It provides a higher-level abstraction for querying and analyzing data stored in HDFS, making it accessible to users familiar with SQL.</p>

  <h2>5. Apache Pig:</h2>
  <p>Pig is a high-level scripting platform built on top of Hadoop that simplifies the development of complex data processing tasks. It uses a scripting language called Pig Latin for expressing data transformations.</p>

  <h2>6. Apache HBase:</h2>
  <p>HBase is a distributed, scalable, and NoSQL database that runs on top of Hadoop. It is designed for storing and retrieving large volumes of sparse data, making it suitable for real-time access to Hadoop data.</p>

  <h2>7. Apache Spark:</h2>
  <p>While not part of the original Hadoop project, Apache Spark is often used in conjunction with Hadoop. It is a fast and general-purpose cluster computing system that supports in-memory processing and provides high-level APIs for various programming languages.</p>

  <h2>8. Hadoop Ecosystem:</h2>
  <p>The Hadoop ecosystem includes a variety of other projects and tools, such as Apache ZooKeeper for distributed coordination, Apache Flume for data ingestion, and Apache Sqoop for data transfer between Hadoop and relational databases.</p>

  <h2>9. Scalability and Fault Tolerance:</h2>
  <p>Hadoop is designed to scale horizontally, allowing organizations to add more nodes to a cluster as data volumes grow. It also provides fault tolerance mechanisms to ensure data availability in the event of node failures.</p>

  <h2>10. Community and Adoption:</h2>
  <p>Apache Hadoop has a large and active community of developers and users. It is widely adopted across industries for processing and analyzing large datasets, making it a foundational technology for big data applications.</p>

  <p>Apache Hadoop plays a crucial role in the big data ecosystem, enabling organizations to store, process, and analyze massive amounts of data efficiently.</p>
