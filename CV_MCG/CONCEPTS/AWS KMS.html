    <h1><a href="KMS_references_jpg.html" target="_blank">AWS Key Management Service (KMS)</a></h1>
    <p>AWS Key Management Service (KMS) is a fully managed service that makes it easy to create and control cryptographic keys used to encrypt your data. KMS is integrated with various AWS services and offers a secure and scalable solution for managing encryption keys.</p>

<h2>Key Features</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Key Creation and Management:</strong> Create, rotate, and manage cryptographic keys used for encryption in a secure and compliant manner.</li>
        <li><strong>Integration with AWS Services:</strong> KMS integrates seamlessly with various AWS services, allowing you to encrypt data stored in S3, EBS volumes, and more.</li>
        <li><strong>Granular Access Control:</strong> Define and manage access policies for your keys using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) to control who can use your keys.</li>
        <li><strong>Key Rotation:</strong> Automate the process of rotating encryption keys to enhance security and compliance with best practices.</li>
        <li><strong>Centralized Key Management:</strong> Use KMS to centrally manage keys across multiple AWS accounts and regions.</li>
        <li><strong>Hardware Security Modules (HSMs):</strong> KMS allows you to use AWS CloudHSM to provide dedicated HSMs for additional hardware security.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Use Cases</h2>
    <p>AWS Key Management Service is commonly used for the following purposes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Data Encryption:</strong> Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit using KMS keys to protect against unauthorized access.</li>
        <li><strong>Compliance Requirements:</strong> Meet compliance requirements by using KMS to manage encryption keys securely and demonstrate key management best practices.</li>
        <li><strong>Secure Multi-Tenancy:</strong> Manage encryption keys centrally when dealing with multiple AWS accounts and applications.</li>
        <li><strong>Application Security:</strong> Integrate KMS with your applications to ensure secure and compliant handling of encryption keys.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>AWS Key Management Service is a fundamental component in securing and managing encryption keys for a wide range of AWS resources and applications.</p>
