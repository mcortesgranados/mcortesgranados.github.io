<p><a href="Lambda_references_jpg.html" target="_blank" class="texto13">AWS Lambda</a> is a serverless computing service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS). It allows you to run code without provisioning or managing servers, making it easier to build and deploy applications that respond to events and scale automatically.</p>
<p>Key features of AWS Lambda include:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Event-driven:</strong> Lambda functions can be triggered by various AWS services, such as Amazon S3, Amazon DynamoDB, Amazon Kinesis, and more. You can also set up custom events using Amazon CloudWatch Events.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Serverless:</strong> With Lambda, you don't need to worry about server provisioning, scaling, or maintenance. AWS automatically takes care of the infrastructure, allowing you to focus on your code.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Scaling:</strong> Lambda automatically scales your application in response to incoming traffic. Each function can run in parallel, and you are charged based on the number of requests and the time your code executes.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Wide Language Support:</strong> Lambda supports multiple programming languages, including Node.js, Python, Java, Ruby, Go, and .NET Core. This allows you to choose the language that best fits your application.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Pay-as-you-go pricing:</strong> With Lambda, you pay only for the compute time that you consume. There are no upfront costs or fees. This can be cost-effective for applications with varying workloads.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Stateless:</strong> Lambda functions are designed to be stateless, meaning they should not rely on the persistence of data between executions. However, you can use other AWS services like Amazon RDS or DynamoDB to store persistent data.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Integrated Logging and Monitoring:</strong> AWS Lambda integrates with AWS CloudWatch for logging and monitoring. You can view logs, set up alarms, and monitor the performance of your functions.</p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>To create a Lambda function, you typically write code, package it along with any dependencies, and upload it to AWS Lambda. You can then configure triggers that will invoke your function based on events.</p>
<p>AWS Lambda is widely used for various purposes, including serverless web applications, data processing, automation, and more. It's a key component in the AWS serverless ecosystem.</p>
