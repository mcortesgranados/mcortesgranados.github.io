<p>Carry  out the development of BPEL Admissions which was intended orchestrating  services exposed within the organization with regard to processes such cmo 1)  Creation of applications, 2) validation of processed through the BPEL Tramite,  3 ) validation of customer-related fraud through the BPEL fraud 4) customer  validation in Datacredito 5) internal validations several through BPEL Score,  BPEL validation PreAprobCallCenter, validation of policies through political  BPEL, WS Georeference, and other processes . Implementation of BPEL Tramite  which was intended orchestrating several services within the organization  related processes such as 1) Deadlock: validacion lock client on all bank  products, see previous applications, and consulting internal systems from the  bank. Fraud BPEL implementation of which was intended orchestrating various  internal services in the organization related processes such as 1) Validation  of restrictive lists 2) Validate client if cell phones are related to processes  of fraud. Implementation of JMSProducer which was intended to expose a rest  service which was intended to produce a message on a JMS queue which in turn  was consumed by unn JMS Adapter and this was redirected to BPEL Admissions for  the generation of the application.</p>
<p>Carry  out the development of two BPELS (Email Producer and Email Consume) which were  intended to implement a mechanism for high availability of messaging via  e-mail, for sending exceptions to the application-level business and system.  The mechanism is worth of the production and consumption of messages through a  JMS queue.</p>
<p>Modification  of a development of Rest WEB Service (MODAC) which was intended to provide  services with respect to the parameterization of the fields which was to handle  the mobile application. Among these changes it was: General corrections logger  management, incorporation Notifier exceptions and connection management  database through the JNDI datasource weblogic. On other developments  (Parametric and JMS Producer) were carried out the same settings mentioned in  the previous paragraph.</p>
<p>Re-process/Implementation  of BPEL which is intended to process on million JSON files for validation  through several other BPEL process exposed as composite which implement complex  business rules. Perfomance increased by reducing execution time from 2 hours to  4 minutes.</p>
<p>Issues  correction related BPEL development.<br />
  Successful  installation and configuration of Infrastructure Enviroment for testing and  pre-production (Configuration of DBAdapters, JMS, Datasources in Weblogic, SOA  Deployment, debugging, and testing).<br />
