<p class="style1"><strong>Company Experience 22</strong><br />
  Company  / NGO Name: <strong>Wizeline</strong><br />
  Position: <strong>Java Software Developer</strong><br />
  Duration:  March/2022 – April/2023 – 1 Year and 1 Month</p>
<p class="style1">In  a notable project, I led the migration of a critical system from C++ to Java  using Java Spark. The objective was to develop a robust REST API catering to a  frontend application focused on Dow Jones data. This migration involved the  implementation of HATEOAS principles and the creation of a generic library in  Java Spark specifically for developing RESTful API services. The result was a  successful deployment to production, demonstrating my expertise in software  development, system architecture, and project management.</p>
<p class="style1">Key  Contributions:</p>
<p class="style1">1.  Codebase Analysis: Conducted a comprehensive analysis of the existing C++  codebase to identify core functionalities, dependencies, and potential  challenges for a seamless migration.</p>
<p class="style1">2.  Architecture Design: Developed a robust architecture plan, leveraging Java  Spark, to ensure scalability, maintainability, and feature-rich capabilities  for the REST API.<br />
  3.  Implementation of HATEOAS:</p>
<p class="style1">Ensured  adherence to HATEOAS principles, allowing for a more intuitive and discoverable  API, enhancing the overall user experience.</p>
<p class="style1">4.  Generic Library in Java Spark:Engineered a generic library within Java Spark  tailored to the specific needs of developing RESTful API services, optimizing  code reuse and maintainability.</p>
<p class="style1">5.  Successful Production Deployment: Orchestrated a smooth transition to  production, emphasizing meticulous testing, performance optimization, and  post-deployment monitoring.<br />
  This  achievement showcases my ability to navigate complex technical challenges, make  informed decisions, and deliver successful outcomes. It reflects my proficiency  in software architecture, programming languages, and dedication to achieving  project goals.</p>
