                    <li data-start="161" data-end="345">

                    </li>
                    <li data-start="349" data-end="595">
                      <p data-start="351" data-end="595"><strong data-start="351" data-end="368">Compatibility</strong>: If there are specific compatibility requirements with other plugins or systems (such as WordPress themes or third-party services), you may need to check which version of Gravity Forms is most compatible with those components.</p>
                    </li>

                    </li>
                    <li data-start="762" data-end="990">
                      <p data-start="764" data-end="990"><strong data-start="764" data-end="779">API Support</strong>: If the integration relies heavily on Gravity Forms API or add-ons, make sure that the version you're using fully supports these functionalities, as some features might only be available in the latest versions.</p>
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                <p data-start="992" data-end="1276">In summary, the choice of version should consider the compatibility needs of your system and the features you require for the integration.
